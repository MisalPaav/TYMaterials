## SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
Semantic Analysis is the third phase of Compiler. Semantic Analysis makes sure that declarations and statements of program are semantically correct. It is a collection of procedures which is called by parser as and when required by grammar. Both syntax tree of previous phase and symbol table are used to check the consistency of the given code. Type checking is an important part of semantic analysis where compiler makes sure that each operator has matching operands.

### Semantic Analyzer:

It uses syntax tree and symbol table to check whether the given program is semantically consistent with language definition. It gathers type information and stores it in either syntax tree or symbol table. This type information is subsequently used by compiler during intermediate-code generation.

### Semantic Errors:

Errors recognized by semantic analyzer are as follows:

- Type mismatch
- Undeclared variables
- Reserved identifier misuse
### Functions of Semantic Analysis:

- Type Checking 
- Ensures that data types are used in a way consistent with their definition.
- Label Checking 
- A program should contain labels references.
- Flow Control Check 
- Keeps a check that control structures are used in a proper manner.(example: no break statement outside a loop)

Example:

    float x = 10.1;

    float y = x\*30;

In the above example integer 30 will be typecasted to float 30.0 before multiplication, by semantic analyzer.

### Static and Dynamic Semantics:

- Static Semantics --
It is named so because of the fact that these are checked at compile time. The static semantics and meaning of program during execution, are indirectly related.

- Dynamic Semantic Analysis --
It defines the meaning of different units of program like expressions and statements. These are checked at runtime unlike static semantics.

## NEED OF SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

- Type Checking: One of the primary purposes of semantic analysis is to perform type checking. It ensures that the types of variables and expressions used in the program are consistent with the language's rules. Type checking helps catch many programming errors at compile-time, such as adding integers to strings or using undefined variables.

- Error Detection and Reporting: Semantic analysis is responsible for detecting and reporting a wide range of semantic errors that may not be caught during the earlier lexical and syntactic analysis phases. These errors include type mismatches, undeclared variables, incompatible assignments, and more. Providing clear and informative error messages is essential for programmers to understand and fix issues in their code.

- Scope Resolution: In programming languages, variables can have different scopes and lifetimes. Semantic analysis helps in determining the scope of variables and ensuring that they are used in a valid and well-defined manner. It also checks for issues like shadowing (when a variable in an inner scope has the same name as one in an outer scope).

- Memory Management: In languages with manual memory management or low-level features like pointers, semantic analysis ensures that memory allocation and deallocation are performed correctly to avoid memory leaks and other memory-related errors.

- Function and Method Resolution: In object-oriented and multi-module languages, semantic analysis helps resolve function and method calls to ensure that the correct function or method is invoked with the appropriate arguments. This includes checking function signatures, overloading, and inheritance-related issues.

- Optimizations: Some semantic analyses perform optimizations at this stage. For example, constant folding can be applied to evaluate constant expressions at compile-time, which can lead to more efficient code generation.

## ABSTRACT PARSE TREES FOR EXPRESSIONS, VARIABLES, STATEMENTS, FUNCTIONS, AND CLASS DECLARATIONS

### Abstract parse trees for expressions

Abstract parse trees (also known as abstract syntax trees or ASTs) for expressions are data structures used in compiler design to represent the hierarchical structure and semantics of expressions in a programming language. These trees provide a structured and abstract view of expressions, which is crucial for various compiler-related tasks such as semantic analysis and code generation. Let's break down the key components and the role of ASTs for expressions:

#### Key Components of ASTs for Expressions:

- Nodes: Nodes in the AST represent elements of an expression, such as operators and operands. Each node has a specific type corresponding to the expression element it represents.
- Edges: Edges connect nodes in the tree to indicate the relationships between elements of the expression. For example, an operator node is connected to its operand nodes.
- Operators: Operator nodes represent operators used in the expression, such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and more. Operator nodes are typically internal nodes in the tree.
- Operands: Operand nodes represent values or sub-expressions involved in the expression. These can be literals (e.g., numbers), variables, function calls, or other expressions. Operand nodes are typically leaf nodes in the tree.

#### Role of ASTs for Expressions:

- Syntax Representation: ASTs capture the syntactic structure of expressions, ensuring that the expressions are correctly composed according to the rules of the programming language's grammar. This includes operator precedence and associativity.
- Operator Hierarchy: The hierarchical structure of the AST reflects the precedence and nesting of operators in the expression. Operators with higher precedence are placed closer to the root of the tree, indicating their higher priority in evaluation.
- Operand Association: Operand nodes are associated with their respective operators, making it clear which operands are operated upon by which operators.
- Type Checking: During semantic analysis, ASTs are used to perform type checking. Each node is associated with a data type, and type consistency is verified across operators and operands.
- Evaluation: ASTs can be used for evaluating expressions. By traversing the tree and applying the operators to their operands, the expression's value can be computed. This is often done during runtime or in interpreters.
- Code Generation: For compiled languages, ASTs are essential for code generation. Compiler backends use the tree to generate machine code or intermediate code that performs the desired computations.
- Optimizations: Some compilers apply optimization techniques to ASTs to improve the efficiency of expression evaluation. Common optimizations include constant folding (evaluating constant expressions at compile-time), common subexpression elimination, and strength reduction.

### Abstract Trees for Variables

Abstract parse trees (also known as abstract syntax trees or ASTs) for variables are data structures used in compiler design to represent the structure and semantics of variable declarations, references, and assignments in a programming language. These trees provide an organized and abstract view of how variables are used within a program, which is essential for various compiler-related tasks such as semantic analysis and code generation. Let's break down the key components and the role of ASTs for variables:

#### **Key Components of ASTs for Variables:**

1. **Nodes:** Nodes in the AST represent elements related to variables, such as variable declarations, references, assignments, and their associated information. Each node has a specific type corresponding to the variable-related element it represents.

2. **Edges:** Edges connect nodes in the tree to indicate relationships between variable-related elements. For instance, a variable reference node is connected to the corresponding declaration node.

3. **Variable Declarations:** Nodes representing variable declarations include information such as the variable's name, data type, scope, and any initial values. These nodes are typically used to capture variable definitions in the source code.

4. **Variable References:** Nodes representing variable references indicate where variables are used in expressions, statements, or function calls. These nodes typically include the variable's name and its context in the code.

5. **Variable Assignments:** Nodes representing variable assignments capture instances where variables are assigned new values. These nodes include information about the assigned value, such as literals, expressions, or other variables.

#### **Role of ASTs for Variables:**

1. **Syntax Representation:** ASTs for variables capture the syntactic structure of variable declarations, references, and assignments. They ensure that variables are correctly defined and used according to the programming language's grammar.

2. **Scope Analysis:** ASTs help in performing scope analysis by representing the scope of variables. This ensures that variables are accessible in the appropriate scopes and that they do not conflict with variables of the same name in different scopes.

3. **Type Checking:** During semantic analysis, ASTs are used for type checking. Each variable node is associated with a data type, and type consistency is verified in variable assignments and expressions involving variables.

4. **Variable Lifecycle:** ASTs help track the lifecycle of variables, including their creation (declaration), references, and any modifications (assignments). This information is crucial for memory management and optimization.

5. **Code Generation:** In the code generation phase of compilation, ASTs provide valuable information about variable declarations and assignments. Compiler backends use this information to generate machine code or intermediate code that manages variables correctly.

6. **Optimizations:** Some compilers apply optimization techniques to ASTs to improve the efficiency of variable-related operations. Common optimizations include dead code elimination and register allocation.

7. **Error Detection:** ASTs can help detect errors related to variables, such as referencing an undeclared variable or redefining a variable in the same scope.

### Abstract Trees for statements

Abstract parse trees (also known as abstract syntax trees or ASTs) for statements are data structures used in compiler design to represent the structure and semantics of statements in a programming language. These trees provide an organized and abstract view of how statements are structured and executed within a program, which is essential for various compiler-related tasks such as semantic analysis and code generation. Let's break down the key components and the role of ASTs for statements:

#### **Key Components of ASTs for Statements:**

1. **Nodes:** Nodes in the AST represent different types of statements, such as assignment statements, conditional statements (if-else), loops (for, while), function calls, and more. Each node has a specific type corresponding to the statement it represents.

2. **Edges:** Edges connect nodes in the tree to indicate relationships between statements, such as control flow, nesting, or dependencies.

3. **Statement Types:** AST nodes can represent various types of statements, including:
   - Assignment Statements: Capturing variable assignments and expressions.
   - Conditional Statements (If-Else): Representing branching based on conditions.
   - Loop Statements: Capturing iterative constructs like for and while loops.
   - Function Calls: Representing the invocation of functions or methods.
   - Return Statements: Indicating the return of values from functions.
   - Break and Continue Statements: Handling loop control flow.

#### **Role of ASTs for Statements:**

1. **Syntax Representation:** ASTs capture the syntactic structure of statements, ensuring that statements are correctly composed according to the programming language's grammar.

2. **Control Flow Analysis:** ASTs are used to analyze control flow within the program. They represent the order and conditions under which statements are executed, helping identify unreachable code and control flow paths.

3. **Scope Analysis:** ASTs help in performing scope analysis by representing the scope of variables and identifiers used within statements. This ensures that variables are accessible where they are used.

4. **Type Checking:** During semantic analysis, ASTs are used for type checking. They verify that expressions and assignments within statements are consistent with the expected data types.

5. **Code Generation:** ASTs provide valuable information about statements that is used in code generation. Compiler backends use this information to generate machine code or intermediate code that executes the program correctly.

6. **Optimizations:** Some compilers apply optimization techniques to ASTs for statements to improve the efficiency of code execution. Common optimizations include dead code elimination, loop unrolling, and common subexpression elimination.

7. **Error Detection:** ASTs can help detect errors related to statements, such as type mismatches, unreachable code, or syntax errors within statements.

### **Abstract Parse Trees for Functions and Class Declarations**

Abstract parse trees (also known as abstract syntax trees or ASTs) for functions and class declarations are data structures used in compiler design to represent the structure and semantics of functions and classes in a programming language. These trees provide an organized and abstract view of how functions and classes are defined and used within a program, which is essential for various compiler-related tasks such as semantic analysis and code generation. Let's break down the key components and the role of ASTs for functions and class declarations:

#### **Key Components of ASTs for Functions and Classes:**

1. **Nodes:** Nodes in the AST represent elements related to functions and classes, such as function/method declarations, parameter lists, return types, class definitions, attributes (variables), and methods (functions). Each node has a specific type corresponding to the function or class element it represents.

2. **Edges:** Edges connect nodes in the tree to indicate relationships between elements of functions and classes, such as function calls, inheritance, method invocations, and attribute accesses.

3. **Function Declarations:** Nodes representing function declarations include information such as the function's name, parameter list, return type, and the code block or body of the function. These nodes capture the definition and signature of functions.

4. **Method Declarations:** In object-oriented languages, method declarations represent functions associated with classes. These nodes include information similar to function declarations but are associated with specific classes.

5. **Class Declarations:** Nodes representing class declarations capture class definitions, including the class name, attributes (variables), methods (functions), and inheritance relationships. They describe the structure and behavior of classes.

#### **Role of ASTs for Functions and Classes:**

1. **Syntax Representation:** ASTs capture the syntactic structure of function and class declarations, ensuring that they are correctly composed according to the programming language's grammar.

2. **Type Checking:** During semantic analysis, ASTs are used for type checking. They verify that function/method invocations match the declared function signatures and that class attributes and methods are accessed correctly.

3. **Scope Analysis:** ASTs help in performing scope analysis by representing the scope of functions, methods, classes, and their associated elements. This ensures that references to functions and classes are valid within their scopes.

4. **Inheritance and Polymorphism:** In object-oriented languages, ASTs represent inheritance relationships and method overriding. This information is essential for ensuring correct behavior of classes and polymorphic behavior.

5. **Code Generation:** ASTs provide valuable information about functions and classes that is used in code generation. Compiler backends use this information to generate machine code or intermediate code that correctly implements functions and classes.

6. **Optimizations:** Some compilers apply optimization techniques to ASTs for functions and classes to improve the efficiency of function calls, method invocations, and attribute accesses.

7. **Error Detection:** ASTs can help detect errors related to functions and classes, such as type mismatches, undefined functions, or violations of inheritance rules.

## **Syntax-Directed Definitions**

Syntax-directed definitions (SDDs) are a formalism used in compiler design and parsing theory to specify the translation of programming language constructs into executable code or other target representations. SDDs are used to describe the relationships between the syntactic elements of a programming language's grammar and the corresponding actions or computations to be performed during parsing. Let's break down the key concepts and the role of SDDs:

### **Key Concepts of Syntax-Directed Definitions:**

1. **Production Rules:** SDDs are closely tied to the production rules of a formal grammar, such as a context-free grammar (CFG). Each production rule defines a syntactic construct in the source language and associates it with a set of semantic actions or computations.

2. **Attributes:** In SDDs, attributes are used to associate data or values with different parts of the syntax tree or parse tree. These attributes can be synthesized attributes (values derived from child nodes and passed up the tree) or inherited attributes (values passed down the tree from parent to child nodes).

3. **Semantic Actions:** SDDs specify semantic actions to be executed at various points in the parsing process. These actions can include code generation, type checking, symbol table operations, and more. Semantic actions are often associated with production rules and attributes.

4. **Syntax Tree or Parse Tree:** SDDs operate on syntax trees or parse trees, which are hierarchical representations of the program's syntactic structure. The syntax tree reflects the structure of the program based on the grammar rules.

### **Role of Syntax-Directed Definitions:**

1. **Translation:** SDDs provide a framework for translating source code into target code or other intermediate representations. The semantic actions associated with production rules define how the source language constructs are mapped to executable operations.

2. **Semantic Analysis:** SDDs play a crucial role in semantic analysis. They enable the detection of type errors, variable scoping, and other semantic constraints during the parsing process.

3. **Code Generation:** SDDs are used to generate code for the target machine or language. The semantic actions associated with production rules guide the code generation process, ensuring that the generated code is correct and efficient.

4. **Optimizations:** SDDs can also be extended to include optimization strategies. Optimizations can be applied during code generation or as separate passes over the generated code.

5. **Error Handling:** SDDs can specify error-handling procedures, allowing the compiler to report and recover from syntax and semantic errors gracefully.

## **Syntax-Directed Translation Schemes for Declaration Processing, Type Analysis, and Scope Analysis**

Syntax-directed translation schemes (SDTSs) are formal specifications used in compiler design to define how programming language constructs are translated into intermediate representations or target code. These schemes are particularly useful for handling declaration processing, type analysis, and scope analysis during the compilation process. Let's explore the key concepts and roles of SDTSs in these areas:

### **Key Concepts of Syntax-Directed Translation Schemes:**

1. **Production Rules:** SDTSs are closely linked to the production rules of a formal grammar, such as a context-free grammar (CFG). Each production rule specifies a language construct and is associated with translation rules or actions.

2. **Attributes:** Attributes are used in SDTSs to associate data or information with elements of the abstract syntax tree (AST) or parse tree. Attributes can be synthesized (values derived from child nodes and passed up the tree) or inherited (values passed down the tree from parent to child nodes).

3. **Semantic Actions:** SDTSs define semantic actions to be executed at various points in the parsing process. These actions encompass operations such as declaration processing, type checking, scope resolution, and code generation.

4. **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):** SDTSs operate on ASTs, which are hierarchical representations of a program's syntactic structure. The AST reflects the structure of the program based on the grammar rules and is used as the basis for translation.

### **Roles of Syntax-Directed Translation Schemes in Compiler Tasks:**

1. **Declaration Processing:** SDTSs play a vital role in processing variable and function declarations. They specify how declarations are recognized, processed, and recorded in the symbol table. Attributes may be used to store information such as data types, scopes, and storage allocation details.

2. **Type Analysis:** SDTSs are used for type analysis, where they define how type information is propagated and checked within expressions and statements. Type consistency and compatibility checks are performed using attribute values associated with AST nodes.

3. **Scope Analysis:** SDTSs facilitate scope analysis by defining how scopes are created, entered, and exited. They ensure that variables and identifiers are correctly scoped and that scope-related errors are detected.

4. **Symbol Table Management:** SDTSs often involve the management of a symbol table, a data structure used to store information about variables, functions, and their properties. SDTSs specify how symbols are added, looked up, and updated in the symbol table.

5. **Code Generation:** In addition to declaration, type, and scope analysis, SDTSs guide the code generation process. Semantic actions associated with production rules define how source language constructs are translated into target code.

6. **Error Handling:** SDTSs can include semantic actions for error detection and reporting. They help identify and report declaration, type, and scope-related errors, improving the robustness of the compiler.

## **Symbol Tables (ST)**

Symbol tables (ST) are fundamental data structures used in compiler design and semantic analysis to manage and organize information about variables, functions, and other program identifiers. Symbol tables play a critical role in ensuring correct scoping, type checking, and semantic analysis during the compilation process. Let's delve into the key concepts and the role of symbol tables in semantic analysis:

### **Key Concepts of Symbol Tables (ST):**

1. **Symbols:** Symbols represent program identifiers, such as variable names, function names, class names, and other named entities in the source code.

2. **Attributes:** Symbol tables associate attributes or properties with symbols. These attributes may include data types, memory locations, scope information, visibility, and other relevant details.

3. **Scope:** Each symbol table corresponds to a specific scope in the program, such as global scope, function scope, or block scope. Symbol tables help in managing the scope hierarchy within a program.

4. **Symbol Table Entries:** Symbol tables store entries for each symbol encountered in the source code. Each entry typically includes the symbol's name and associated attributes.

5. **Lookup and Resolution:** Symbol tables provide efficient lookup mechanisms for finding symbol information. This is crucial for identifying variable declarations, resolving function calls, and ensuring scope-related rules are followed.

### **Roles of Symbol Tables (ST) in Semantic Analysis:**

1. **Declaration Processing:** Symbol tables are used to process variable and function declarations. When a declaration is encountered in the source code, the corresponding symbol and its attributes are added to the appropriate symbol table.

2. **Scope Management:** Symbol tables manage scopes by representing the scope hierarchy within a program. They help in determining the visibility and accessibility of symbols within different scopes.

3. **Identifier Resolution:** During semantic analysis, symbol tables are consulted to resolve identifiers. This includes finding the declaration of a variable or function when it is referenced elsewhere in the code.

4. **Type Checking:** Symbol tables assist in type checking by associating data types with symbols. Type consistency is verified when symbols are used in expressions, assignments, and function calls.

5. **Error Detection:** Symbol tables aid in error detection by identifying issues such as undeclared variables, redeclarations, and type mismatches. They play a crucial role in reporting meaningful error messages to the programmer.

6. **Code Generation:** In some cases, symbol tables are used during code generation to determine memory locations and access patterns for variables and functions.

7. **Optimizations:** Symbol tables may be employed in optimization strategies to analyze the usage of variables and functions, enabling optimizations such as dead code elimination and variable reuse.

## **Organization of Symbol Tables (ST) for Block-Structured and Non-Block Structured Languages**

Symbol tables (ST) serve as vital components in compiler design, managing and organizing information about variables, functions, and other identifiers. The organization of symbol tables varies depending on whether the programming language being compiled is block-structured or non-block structured. Let's explore the key concepts and the organization of ST for these two language paradigms:

### **For Block-Structured Languages:**

In block-structured languages, the program is divided into nested blocks or scopes, each with its own local variables and declarations. The organization of symbol tables in such languages typically follows these principles:

1. **Scope Hierarchy:** Symbol tables are organized hierarchically to represent the nesting of scopes. Each block or function has its own symbol table, and these tables are linked to form a scope hierarchy.

2. **Local and Global Scopes:** Symbol tables distinguish between local scopes (e.g., block-level or function-level) and the global scope. Local symbol tables are nested within the global symbol table.

3. **Entry and Exit Actions:** When entering a new block or function, a new local symbol table is created. When exiting the block or function, the local symbol table is discarded, and the program returns to the previous scope.

4. **Symbol Resolution:** Identifier resolution starts with the innermost scope and progresses outward. Local symbols take precedence over global symbols with the same name.

5. **Access and Visibility:** Symbols declared within a block are accessible only within that block or nested blocks. This ensures that variables in one block do not interfere with those in other blocks.

6. **Shadowing:** Local symbols can shadow (hide) global symbols with the same name within the local scope. This allows for local variables to have the same name as global ones.

### **For Non-Block Structured Languages:**

In non-block structured languages, there may be a global scope, but there are no nested block scopes as in block-structured languages. The organization of symbol tables for non-block structured languages typically adheres to these principles:

1. **Global Scope:** In non-block structured languages, there is often a single global symbol table that encompasses the entire program.

2. **Single Scope:** Since there are no nested blocks, all variables and functions exist within the global scope, and there is no distinction between local and global symbol tables.

3. **Flat Hierarchy:** The symbol table for non-block structured languages maintains a flat hierarchy, with all symbols at the same level.

4. **Symbol Resolution:** Identifier resolution occurs within a single scope, as there are no nested scopes to traverse. Names must be unique across the program.

5. **Access and Visibility:** Symbols are accessible and visible throughout the entire program, as there are no block-level or function-level scoping rules.

6. **No Shadowing:** In non-block structured languages, there is no concept of shadowing since there are no nested scopes where symbols could be redefined.

## **Symbol Table Management in Semantic Analysis**

Symbol table management is a critical aspect of semantic analysis in compiler design. Symbol tables are data structures that store information about variables, functions, and other identifiers used in a program. Properly managing symbol tables is essential for ensuring correct scoping, type checking, and semantic analysis during the compilation process. Let's explore the key concepts and strategies involved in symbol table management:

### **Key Concepts of Symbol Table Management:**

1. **Symbol Representation:** Symbols represent program identifiers, such as variable names, function names, and class names. Each symbol is associated with attributes, which include information such as data types, memory locations, and scope.

2. **Scope Hierarchy:** Symbol tables are organized hierarchically to reflect the scope hierarchy within a program. This hierarchy includes global scope, function or method scopes, and block-level scopes.

3. **Entry and Exit Actions:** When entering a new scope, a new symbol table is typically created to represent that scope. When exiting the scope, the symbol table is discarded. This allows for proper scoping and resolution of identifiers.

4. **Symbol Resolution:** Symbol tables are consulted during semantic analysis to resolve identifiers. The process involves searching symbol tables in a hierarchical manner, starting from the innermost scope and progressing outward.

5. **Error Detection:** Symbol tables play a crucial role in detecting errors related to undeclared variables, redeclarations, type mismatches, and scope violations. Proper error messages are generated based on symbol table information.

6. **Access Control:** Symbol tables help enforce access control rules, ensuring that identifiers are accessed only within their valid scopes. This includes visibility rules for local and global variables.

### **Strategies for Symbol Table Management:**

1. **Hierarchical Structure:** Symbol tables are organized hierarchically to match the nesting of scopes in the program. Each scope has its corresponding symbol table, forming a nested structure.

2. **Local and Global Scopes:** Symbol tables distinguish between local scopes (e.g., block-level or function-level) and the global scope. Local symbol tables are nested within the global symbol table.

3. **Entry and Exit Actions:** When a new scope is entered, a new symbol table is created, and when the scope is exited, the symbol table is discarded. This dynamic allocation of symbol tables ensures proper scope management.

4. **Scope Resolution:** Symbol resolution involves traversing the hierarchy of symbol tables to find the declaration of an identifier. Scopes are searched in a nested order, with local scopes taking precedence over global ones.

5. **Symbol Attributes:** Symbol tables associate attributes with symbols, which store information such as data types, memory locations, and visibility. These attributes are used for type checking and code generation.

6. **Error Reporting:** Symbol tables are used to detect and report semantic errors. When an undeclared variable is used or a redeclaration occurs, the symbol table provides information to generate meaningful error messages.

In summary, symbol table management is a fundamental component of semantic analysis in compiler design. It ensures proper scoping, resolution of identifiers, type checking, and error detection. Symbol tables are organized hierarchically to match the scope hierarchy within a program and play a pivotal role in maintaining the correctness and reliability of the compiled code.
