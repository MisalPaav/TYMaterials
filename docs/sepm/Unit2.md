### Software Requirements (Functional and Non-Functional)

**Software Requirements:** Software requirements are the descriptions of what a software system should do and how it should behave. They serve as the foundation for the design, implementation, and testing of the software. Requirements provide a clear and detailed understanding of the expected functionality, features, and constraints of the software.

**Functional Requirements:** Functional requirements describe what the software should do in terms of specific functions, features, and interactions with users or other systems. These requirements are action-oriented and focus on the software's behavior in response to different inputs and conditions. Examples of functional requirements include user authentication, data validation, report generation, and data processing.

**Non-Functional Requirements:** Non-functional requirements, also known as quality attributes or software qualities, specify how the software should perform rather than what it should do. These requirements address aspects such as performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability, and maintainability. Non-functional requirements are critical for ensuring that the software meets user expectations and industry standards.

**Difference Between Functional & Non-Functional Requirements:**

| Functional Requirements         | Non-Functional Requirements            |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| A functional requirement defines a system or its component. | A non-functional requirement defines the quality attribute of a software system. |
| It specifies “What should the software system do?” | It places constraints on “How should the software system fulfill the functional requirements?” |
| Functional requirement is specified by User. | Non-functional requirement is specified by technical people (e.g., Architect, Technical leaders, and software developers). |
| It is mandatory. | It is not mandatory. |
| It is captured in use case. | It is captured as a quality attribute. |
| Defined at a component level. | Applied to a system as a whole. |
| Helps you verify the functionality of the software. | Helps you to verify the performance of the software. |
| Functional Testing like System, Integration, End to End, API testing, etc are done. | Non-Functional Testing like Performance, Stress, Usability, Security testing, etc are done. |
| Usually easy to define. | Usually more difficult to define. |
| Example                       | Example                               |
| 1) Authentication of the user whenever he/she logs into the system. | 1) Emails should be sent with a latency of no greater than 12 hours from such an activity. |
| 2) System shutdown in case of a cyber attack. | 2) The processing of each request should be done within 10 seconds. |
| 3) A verification email is sent to the user whenever he/she registers for the first time on some software system. | 3) The site should load in 3 seconds when the number of simultaneous users is > 10000. |

**Challenges in Classical Analysis:**

1. **Complexity:** For large and complex systems, structured analysis and Petri Nets can become complex and challenging to manage.

2. **Evolutionary Limitations:** These techniques may have limitations when it comes to modeling modern, dynamic, and highly interactive software systems.

3. **Learning Curve:** Learning and mastering these techniques can be time-consuming for project teams.

**Best Practices in Using Classical Analysis Techniques:**

1. **Tailored Approach:** Apply these techniques as appropriate for the specific project and system being analyzed. In some cases, a mix of modern and classical techniques may be more effective.

2. **Documentation:** Maintain clear and well-documented models, diagrams, and data dictionaries to ensure that they remain accessible and understandable.

3. **Training and Skill Development:** Provide training and support to project teams to help them use these techniques effectively.

4. **Collaboration:** Foster collaboration among stakeholders and development teams to ensure that the analysis and design are accurate and meet the project's needs.
