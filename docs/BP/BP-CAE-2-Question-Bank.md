**Relationships:**

- One-to-Many: Users to Posts (One user can have multiple posts)
- One-to-Many: Posts to Comments (One post can have multiple comments)
- Many-to-Many: Users to Likes (One user can like multiple posts, and one post can be liked by multiple users)

### 3. Discuss the role of PHP in interacting with MySQL databases with example

PHP is commonly used to create dynamic web pages and interact with MySQL databases to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data.
Example:

```php
<?php
    // Establishing a connection to MySQL database
    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "username";
    $password = "password";
    $database = "dbname";

    $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $database);

    // Checking connection
    if ($conn->connect_error) {
        die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
    }

    // Querying database
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM users";
    $result = $conn->query($sql);

    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
        // Output data of each row
        while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
            echo "ID: " . $row["id"]. " - Name: " . $row["name"]. "<br>";
        }
    } else {
        echo "0 results";
    }

    // Closing connection
    $conn->close();
?>
```

### 4. Identify common security risks associated with integrating PHP and MySQL and how to mitigate them

- **SQL Injection:** Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent user input from being directly interpreted as SQL commands.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Validate and sanitize user input to prevent execution of malicious scripts.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Encrypt sensitive data before storing it in the database, and ensure secure transmission using HTTPS.
- **Weak Authentication:** Implement strong password policies, use secure authentication methods like bcrypt, and avoid storing passwords in plain text.
- **Insufficient Authorization:** Implement access control mechanisms to restrict users' access to only necessary data and functionalities.  

### 5. Explain how PHP can be used to establish a connection to a MySQL database

PHP provides various methods to connect to a MySQL database, commonly using the `mysqli` or `PDO` extensions.
Example using `mysqli`:

```php
<?php
    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "username";
    $password = "password";
    $database = "dbname";

    // Create connection
    $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $database);

    // Check connection
    if ($conn->connect_error) {
        die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
    }
    echo "Connected successfully";
?>
   
```

Example using `PDO`:

```php
<?php
    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "username";
    $password = "password";
    $database = "dbname";

    try {
        $conn = new PDO("mysql:host=$servername;dbname=$database", $username, $password);
        // Set the PDO error mode to exception
        $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
        echo "Connected successfully";
    } catch(PDOException $e) {
        echo "Connection failed: " . $e->getMessage();
    }
?>
```

### 6. Write a MySQL query to retrieve data from a table based on specific criteria

`SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE USER_LOCATION = 'PUNE';`

### 7. Analyze a complex MySQL query and explain how it retrieves data from multiple tables

```sql
SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name, products.product_name
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
INNER JOIN order_details ON orders.order_id = order_details.order_id
INNER JOIN products ON order_details.product_id = products.product_id;
```

This query retrieves data from multiple tables (`orders`, `customers`, `order_details`, `products`) using INNER JOINs to match related records based on foreign key relationships. It selects specific columns (`order_id`, `customer_name`, `product_name`) and filters data accordingly.

### 8. Identify potetntial issues that may arise when connecting to a MySQL database using PHP and how to troubleshoot them

- **Connection Errors:** Check database credentials, hostname, and port. Ensure MySQL server is running.
- **Permission Issues:** Verify that the user has appropriate privileges to access the database.
- **Syntax Errors:** Review PHP and SQL syntax for errors. Use error handling and logging to identify issues.
- **Firewall or Network Issues:** Check firewall settings and network configurations to ensure connectivity.
- **Server Load:** High server load can cause connection timeouts. Monitor server resources and optimize queries if necessary.

### 9. Write SQL queries to update, insert and delete records in a MySQL database

**Update Record:**

- `UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;`

**Insert Record:**

- `INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);`

**Delete Record:**

- `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`

### 11. Define Node.js and Express framework. What is their relationship

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside the browser. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient for building scalable network applications.

**Express framework**:

- Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features.

**Relationship between Node.js and Express**:

- Node.js provides the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side, while Express is a framework that runs on top of Node.js, providing additional utilities and features for building web applications. Express simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware integration, and more, making it easier and faster to develop web applications with Node.js.

### 12. Desscribe tools and techniques for debugging Express applications

- **Logging**: Utilize logging libraries like `morgan` to log HTTP requests and responses, helping to track the flow of requests through the application.
- **Debugging Middleware**: Use middleware like `debug` to add debug logging throughout the application to trace the flow of data and identify potential issues.
- **Error Handling Middleware**: Implement error handling middleware to catch and log errors, providing detailed information about the error and its context.
- **Debugging Tools**: Use Node.js debugging tools like `Node Inspector` or `Chrome DevTools` for inspecting and debugging Node.js applications, including Express apps.
- **Testing Frameworks**: Employ testing frameworks like `Mocha` or `Jest` along with assertion libraries like `Chai` to write and execute unit tests and integration tests to identify and fix issues in Express applications.

### 13. Identify common routing patterns used in Express applications and their purpose

- **Static Routes**: Define routes for static files like HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript files, serving them directly from the file system.
- **Dynamic Routes**: Define routes with parameters to handle dynamic content, such as user profiles or product pages, where the URL structure contains variable parts.
- **Middleware Routes**: Use middleware functions to execute code before handling a request, allowing for tasks like authentication, logging, or data validation.
- **Error Handling Routes**: Define routes or middleware to handle errors and send appropriate responses, ensuring a graceful handling of errors and preventing crashing of the application.
- **API Routes**: Design routes specifically for serving JSON data or handling API requests, following RESTful principles for organizing and accessing resources.

### 14. Evaluate the benefits of using MVC in Express for organizing and maintaining the code

- **Modularity**: MVC architecture divides the application into separate components (Model, View, Controller), making it easier to manage and maintain each part independently.
- **Separation of Concerns**: MVC separates business logic (Model), presentation logic (View), and request handling logic (Controller), promoting code organization and readability.
- **Reusability**: Components like models and views can be reused across multiple parts of the application, reducing code duplication and improving consistency.
- **Scalability**: MVC architecture facilitates the scalability of the application by allowing developers to add or modify components without impacting other parts of the application.
- **Testability**: MVC promotes test-driven development by enabling developers to write unit tests for each component independently, ensuring the reliability and stability of the application.

### 15. Discuss MVC architecture and explain how it is implemented in web applications

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It interacts with the database, processes data, and performs business operations. In Express, models are typically implemented using ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) like Sequelize or Mongoose.
- **View**: Presents the user interface and visual elements of the application. It displays data to users and handles user interactions. Views in Express are typically implemented using template engines like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars.
- **Controller**: Handles user requests, processes input data, and interacts with models and views to generate responses. Controllers contain the application logic and route definitions. In Express, controllers are implemented using route handlers and middleware functions, organizing request handling and business logic.

### 16. Create custom middleware functions for logging and error handling in an Express application

```javascript
// Logging middleware function
const logger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url} - ${new Date()}`);
  next(); // Call next middleware in the chain
};

// Error handling middleware function
const errorHandler = (err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
};

// Register middleware functions in Express app
app.use(logger);
app.use(errorHandler);
```

### 17. Compare different template engines supported by Express and their features

**EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**:

- Simple and familiar syntax similar to HTML.
- Supports JavaScript logic within templates.
- Widely used with a large community and extensive documentation.
- Good for small to medium-sized projects.

**Pug (formerly Jade)**:

- Uses indentation-based syntax for readability.
- Concise and expressive syntax reduces code verbosity.
- Supports mixins and includes for reusability.
- Popular choice for larger projects and teams.

**Handlebars**:

- Uses simple template syntax with double curly braces `{{}}`.
- Supports partials and helpers for code reuse and extensibility.
- Great for building static pages and web applications with complex logic.
- Compatible with various JavaScript frameworks.

### 18. Discuss how middleware functions are used in the request-response cycle

- Middleware functions in Express are functions that have access to the `req`, `res`, and `next` objects in the request-response cycle.
- They can execute any code, make changes to the request and response objects, and end the request-response cycle by sending a response or passing control to the next middleware function.
- Middleware functions are executed sequentially in the order they are registered using `app.use()` or when attached to specific routes using `app.use()` or `router.use()`.
- They can perform tasks such as logging, authentication, data parsing, error handling, and more, allowing for modular and reusable code in Express applications.

### 19. Compare the different template engines supported by Express and their features

- **EJS**: Performance is decent for small to medium-sized applications. It compiles templates to JavaScript functions at runtime.
- **Pug**: Performance is good due to its concise syntax and efficient compilation process. Pug templates are compiled to JavaScript functions, resulting in fast rendering.
- **Handlebars**: Performance is generally good, especially for caching templates. Handlebars compiles templates to JavaScript functions with a simple syntax, making it efficient for rendering.

### 20. Identify and discuss common error handling techniques in Express applications

- **Error Handling Middleware**: Define middleware functions to catch and handle errors, providing custom error responses and logging error details.
- **try-catch**: Use try-catch blocks in route handlers or controller functions to catch synchronous errors and handle them appropriately.
- **Promises and Async/Await**: Handle asynchronous operations using promises or async/await syntax, catching errors using try-catch blocks or promise.catch().
- **Error Objects**: Use built-in Error objects or create custom error classes to represent different types of errors and provide meaningful error messages.
- **Global Error Handling**: Implement a global error handler to catch unhandled errors and prevent the application from crashing, ensuring graceful error handling and fallback responses.
