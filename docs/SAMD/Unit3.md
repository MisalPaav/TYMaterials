#### Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) and Unified Modeling Language (UML)

**Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA):**

Object-Oriented Analysis is an approach to system analysis and design that revolves around the concept of objects. Objects encapsulate data and behavior, allowing for the modeling of real-world entities and their interactions. The key principles of OOA include:

1. **Objects:**

    - **Definition:** Instances of classes that encapsulate data and behaviors.
    - **Role:** Represent real-world entities and concepts within the system.
2. **Classes:**

    - **Definition:** Blueprints or templates for creating objects.
    - **Role:** Define the attributes and behaviors common to a group of objects.
3. **Encapsulation:**

    - **Definition:** The bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class).
    - **Role:** Promotes information hiding and modularity.
4. **Inheritance:**

    - **Definition:** Mechanism for creating a new class by inheriting attributes and behaviors from an existing class.
    - **Role:** Promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchy of classes.
5. **Polymorphism:**

    - **Definition:** The ability of objects to take on multiple forms or behaviors based on the context.
    - **Role:** Enhances flexibility and adaptability in the system.

**Unified Modeling Language (UML):**

UML is a standardized modeling language that facilitates the visualization, specification, construction, and documentation of systems. It is a widely adopted notation in the field of software engineering and system development. Key UML diagrams used in system requirement specifications include:

1. **Use Case Diagrams:**

    - **Purpose:** Illustrate the interactions between actors (users) and the system by representing use cases and their relationships.
    - **Components:** Actors, use cases, relationships.
2. **Activity Diagrams:**

    - **Purpose:** Visualize the workflow and activities within a system, depicting the sequence of actions.
    - **Components:** Activities, transitions, decision points.
3. **Class Diagrams:**

    - **Purpose:** Represent the static structure of a system by illustrating classes, their attributes, and relationships.
    - **Components:** Classes, attributes, relationships.
4. **Sequence Diagrams:**

    - **Purpose:** Showcase the interactions between objects over time, emphasizing the sequence of messages.
    - **Components:** Objects, lifelines, messages.
5. **State Diagrams:**

    - **Purpose:** Model the different states that an object or system can be in, along with state transitions.
    - **Components:** States, transitions, events.
6. **Component Diagrams:**

    - **Purpose:** Illustrate the components of a system and their relationships, emphasizing system architecture.
    - **Components:** Components, interfaces, relationships.
7. **Deployment Diagrams:**

    - **Purpose:** Visualize the physical deployment of system components on hardware nodes.
    - **Components:** Nodes, components, relationships.

**Modelling Using UML:**

1. **Use Cases:**

    - **Description:** Use cases capture system functionalities from a user's perspective. They outline interactions between actors (users) and the system.
2. **Activity Diagrams:**

**Object-Oriented Development Life Cycle:**

The Object-Oriented Development Life Cycle encompasses the stages involved in developing a system using an object-oriented approach. It typically includes the following phases:

1. **Requirements Gathering:**
