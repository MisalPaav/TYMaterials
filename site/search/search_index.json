The algorithm requires labeled data, meaning each data point has a known outcome that the model tries to predict.</p> </li> <li> <p>Step 2: Root Node Selection: The Decision Tree begins with the root node, representing the entire dataset. It evaluates all available features and selects the one that best splits the data into subsets based on some criteria. The criteria can vary, but commonly used ones include Gini impurity, entropy, or mean squared error, depending on whether you're doing classification or regression.</p> </li> <li> <p>Step 3: Splitting: Once the feature for the root node is selected, the dataset is divided into subsets based on the feature's values. For categorical data, it creates branches for each category; for continuous data, it selects a threshold value. These splits continue recursively for each branch, creating child nodes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Step 4: Recursive Splitting: The algorithm continues splitting the data at each node based on the feature that minimizes the chosen impurity criterion. This process is repeated until a stopping condition is met. Common stopping conditions include reaching a predetermined depth, a minimum number of samples in a node, or when further splits do not improve the model's performance significantly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Step 5: Leaf Node Assignment: As the tree grows, it creates leaf nodes representing the final predictions. For classification tasks, the majority class in a leaf node is the predicted class, while for regression, it's the average of the target values in that node.</p> </li> <li> <p>Step 6: Prediction: To make predictions, you follow the path from the root to a leaf node based on the feature values of the input data. The value in the leaf node is then returned as the model's prediction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Step 7: Pruning (Optional): To prevent overfitting, Decision Trees can be pruned by removing branches that do not significantly improve model performance. Pruning helps create a more generalized and interpretable tree.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Decision Trees are interpretable and easy to visualize, making them valuable for understanding the decision-making process within the model. However, they can be prone to overfitting, which can be mitigated with techniques like pruning or using ensemble methods like Random Forests.</p>"},{"location":"BIA/BIA-CAE-2-Question-Bank/#17-explain-r-square","title":"17. Explain R-Square","text":"<p>R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure used to assess the goodness-of-fit of a regression model. It quantifies the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (the target) that is explained by the independent variables (features) in the model. R-squared values range from 0 to 1, where:</p> <ul> <li>R-squared = 0: The model does not explain any variance in the target variable.</li> <li>R-squared = 1: The model perfectly explains the variance in the target variable.</li> </ul> <p>Mathematically, R-squared is defined as:</p> <p>R2=1\u2212SSRSSTR2=1\u2212SSTSSR\u200b</p> <ul> <li> <p>SSR (Sum of Squared Residuals): This represents the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the regression model.

It is particularly useful when dealing with multiple regression models where more than one independent variable is considered. Adjusted R-squared penalizes the inclusion of irrelevant predictors, preventing the inflation of R-squared due to the addition of variables that do not contribute significantly to the model's performance.</p> <p>The formula for Adjusted R-squared is:</p> <p>AdjustedR2=1\u2212(1\u2212R2)\u22c5(n\u22121)n\u2212k\u22121AdjustedR2=1\u2212n\u2212k\u22121(1\u2212R2)\u22c5(n\u22121)\u200b</p> <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>R2R2 is the regular R-squared.</li> <li>nn is the number of data points.</li> <li>kk is the number of predictors (independent variables).</li> </ul> <p>Let's illustrate Adjusted R-squared with an example:</p> <p>Suppose you are building a multiple linear regression model to predict a person's income based on three features: education level, years of experience, and age.

Plugging these values into the formula:</p> <p>AdjustedR2=1\u2212(1\u22120.75)\u22c5(100\u22121)100\u22123\u22121=0.7237AdjustedR2=1\u2212100\u22123\u22121(1\u22120.75)\u22c5(100\u22121)\u200b=0.7237</p> <p>So, the Adjusted R-squared is 0.7237. This adjusted value takes into account the number of predictors and provides a more accurate measure of how well the model fits the data, accounting for potential overfitting. In this example, an Adjusted R-squared of 0.7237 means that 72.37% of the variance in income is explained by the model while considering the number of predictors.</p>"},{"location":"BIA/BIA-CAE-3-Question-Bank/","title":"Business Intellegince Analytics CAE 3 Question Bank","text":"<ul> <li>Business Intellegince Analytics CAE 3 Question Bank</li> <li>Answers</li> <li>1.

They provide fast and efficient access to data based on a unique key. Examples of key-value stores include Redis, Amazon DynamoDB, and Riak.</p> </li> <li> <p>Document Stores: Document stores are designed to store, retrieve, and manage semi-structured data as documents. Documents can be in formats like JSON, BSON, XML, or others. These databases allow for flexible schema design and are suitable for use cases where data is hierarchical or nested. Examples of document stores include MongoDB, Couchbase, and CouchDB.</p> </li> <li> <p>Column Family Stores (Wide Column Stores): Column family stores organize data into columns rather than rows, making them efficient for handling large volumes of data with high write and read throughput. They are well-suited for use cases involving time-series data, event logging, and analytics. Examples of column family stores include Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, and ScyllaDB.</p> </li> <li> <p>Graph Databases: Graph databases are optimized for managing and querying relationships between data entities represented as nodes, edges, and properties.

This mismatch often leads to complexities in mapping data structures between the database and the application, resulting in inefficiencies and increased development effort.</p> <p>In the context of NoSQL databases, impedance mismatch can still occur but in a different form. NoSQL databases often have different data models compared to relational databases, such as document-based, key-value, or column-family models.

It is a markup language that web developers use to structure the content of web pages. At its core, HTML consists of a series of elements, each designed for a specific purpose. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the essential concepts and elements that make up HTML.</p> <p>HTML Elements Defined</p> <p>HTML elements are the basic units of structure in an HTML document. They consist of tags, attributes, and content. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets and define the beginning and end of an element. Content is the data contained within the element, and attributes provide additional information about the element.</p> <p>Here is a breakdown of the basic structure of an HTML element:</p> <ul> <li>Opening Tag: The opening tag marks the beginning of the element and contains the element name. For example, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is the opening tag for a paragraph element.</li> <li>Attributes: Some elements have attributes that provide extra information about the element. Attributes appear within the opening tag and are written as name-value pairs. An example is the <code>href</code> attribute in an anchor (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) element, which specifies the hyperlink destination.</li> <li>Content: The content is the actual data or text that the element contains. For instance, within a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element, you place the text or content of the paragraph.</li> <li>Closing Tag: The closing tag marks the end of the element and is similar to the opening tag, but with a forward slash (<code>/</code>) before the element name. For example, <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> is the closing tag for a paragraph.</li> </ul> <p>Here's an example of a complete HTML element that defines a link:</p> <p><code>&lt;a href=\"https://www.example.com\"&gt;Visit Example&lt;/a&gt;</code></p> <p>In this example:</p> <ul> <li><code>&lt;a&gt;</code> is the opening tag.</li> <li><code>href=\"https://www.example.com\"</code> is an attribute that specifies the link's destination.</li> <li><code>Visit Example</code> is the content of the link.</li> <li><code>&lt;/a&gt;</code> is the closing tag.</li> </ul> <p>The Document Structure</p> <p>HTML documents are hierarchical in nature and have a specific structure. At the top level, you have the entire HTML document enclosed within <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tags. Inside the HTML document, there are two main sections: the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</p> <ol> <li>Head Section: The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section contains metadata about the document, such as the title of the page, character encoding, and links to external resources like CSS stylesheets or JavaScript files. It doesn't display visible content on the web page.</li> </ol> <p><code>&lt;head&gt;         &lt;title&gt;My Web Page&lt;/title&gt;         &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;         &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"&gt;     &lt;/head&gt;</code></p> <ul> <li>Body Section: The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section contains the visible content of the web page, including text, images, links, and other elements.</li> </ul> <p><code>&lt;body&gt;         &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Web Page&lt;/h1&gt;         &lt;p&gt;This is a sample paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"An image\"&gt;         &lt;a href=\"https://www.example.com\"&gt;Visit Example&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/body&gt;</code></p> <p>By combining various HTML elements within the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section, you can create rich and structured web content.</p> <p>Semantic HTML Elements</p> <p>HTML offers a wide range of elements designed to convey meaning and structure to your web documents. Semantic HTML elements go beyond simple formatting and provide context to the content they enclose. Some common semantic elements include:</p> <ul> <li><code>&lt;header&gt;</code>: Represents a container for introductory content, often containing logos, headings, and navigation menus.</li> <li><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>: Defines a navigation menu, typically used for site navigation links.</li> <li><code>&lt;section&gt;</code>: Represents a thematic grouping of content, such as a chapter, tabbed content, or a news article.</li> <li><code>&lt;article&gt;</code>: Encloses a self-contained composition, such as a blog post or news story.</li> <li><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>: Contains content that is tangentially related to the content around it, like a sidebar or advertising.</li> <li><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>: Represents a container for the footer of a section or a page, often containing copyright information, contact details, or related links.</li> </ul> <p>Using semantic elements not only improves accessibility for users with disabilities but also helps search engines better understand and index your content.</p>"},{"location":"WD/Unit3/#working-with-text","title":"Working with Text","text":"<p>Working with text is a fundamental aspect of web development, and HTML provides a variety of elements and tags to help structure and present textual content on webpages. This article will delve into the nuances of working with text in HTML, including headings, paragraphs, inline text formatting, and more.</p> <p>Headings (h1 to h6)</p> <p>HTML offers six levels of headings, ranging from <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>, to create a hierarchical structure for your content. These headings define the importance and organization of text on a webpage, with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> being the most significant and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> the least. Headings are essential for accessibility, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and overall content organization.</p> <p>Here's an example of how to use headings:</p> <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Main Heading&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Subheading&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Sub-subheading&lt;/h3&gt;`\n</code></pre> <p>By using headings appropriately, you provide clear and meaningful structure to your content, making it easier for both users and search engines to understand the hierarchy of information.</p> <p>Paragraphs (p)</p> <p>The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element is used to create paragraphs of text. It is one of the most commonly used HTML tags for organizing textual content. Paragraphs provide visual separation and improve readability.</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>html</p> <p><code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph of text. It can contain multiple sentences and spans several lines.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p> <p>Paragraphs are block-level elements, which means they create a new block of content, pushing subsequent elements to a new line. They are especially useful for structuring long-form text, such as articles or blog posts.</p> <p>Inline Text Formatting (Bold and Italic)</p> <p>HTML allows you to format text inline using elements like <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>.</p> <ul> <li><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>: The <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element is used to indicate strong importance or emphasis. By default, browsers typically render <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> text as bold.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <p><code>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;important&lt;/strong&gt; information.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p> <ul> <li><code>&lt;em&gt;</code>: The <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> element is used to emphasize text, often rendered as italic by browsers.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <p><code>&lt;p&gt;This text is &lt;em&gt;emphasized&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p> <p>These inline formatting elements provide a way to highlight specific words or phrases within a paragraph or heading, enhancing the readability and visual appeal of your content.</p> <p>Text Alignment</p> <p>You can control the alignment of text within HTML elements using CSS styles. Common text alignment options include left-align, right-align, center, and justified alignment.</p> <p>Example using CSS:</p> <p><code>&lt;p style=\"text-align: center;\"&gt;This text is centered.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p> <p>By adjusting the text alignment, you can create visually appealing layouts for your content, improving the overall design of your webpage.</p> <p>Text Indentation</p> <p>HTML/CSS also allows you to control text indentation, which can be helpful for creating structured and visually appealing content. You can use the <code>text-indent</code> property in CSS to specify the amount of indentation.</p> <p>Example:</p> <p><code>&lt;p style=\"text-indent: 30px;\"&gt;This paragraph has an indentation of 30 pixels.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p> <p>Indentation can be useful for creating lists, quotes, or other content elements where a hierarchical structure is needed.</p> <p>Text Transform</p> <p>The <code>text-transform</code> property in CSS allows you to control the capitalization of text. It can be used to make text uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize the first letter of each word.</p> <p>Example:</p> <p><code>&lt;p style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\"&gt;This text is in uppercase.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p style=\"text-transform: lowercase;\"&gt;This text is in lowercase.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p style=\"text-transform: capitalize;\"&gt;This text is capitalized.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p> <p>Text transformation can be particularly useful for headings, labels, and navigation menus, where consistent text formatting is essential.</p> <p>Text Decoration</p> <p>HTML/CSS provides options for text decoration, allowing you to add underlines, overlines, and strikethroughs to text.</p> <p>Example: <code>&lt;p style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;This text has an underline.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p style=\"text-decoration: overline;\"&gt;This text has an overline.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"&gt;This text has a strikethrough.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p> <p>Text decoration is often used to indicate links, emphasize specific content, or add visual cues to text.</p> <p>Text Color</p> <p>You can change the color of text using CSS. The <code>color</code> property allows you to specify a color using various formats, such as color names, hexadecimal codes, or RGB values.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>&lt;p style=\"color: #ff0000;\"&gt;This text is red.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=\"color: blue;\"&gt;This text is blue.&lt;/p&gt;`\n</code></pre> <p>Customizing text colors enables you to create visually appealing designs and ensure that your content aligns with your website's color scheme.</p>"},{"location":"WD/Unit3/#working-with-lists","title":"Working with Lists","text":"<p>HTML provides powerful tools for structuring content on webpages, and one of the fundamental ways to organize information is by using lists.

These styles are defined in a separate CSS file or embedded within an HTML document using <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags. To create an effective style sheet, you need to understand the following concepts:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Selectors: Selectors are used to target specific HTML elements that you want to style. CSS provides various types of selectors, including element selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors. Here's an example:</p> <p>css</p> </li> <li> <p>```/ Element Selector /   p {       color: blue;   }</p> </li> </ol> <p>/ Class Selector /   .highlight {       background-color: yellow;   }</p> <p>/ ID Selector /   #header {       font-size: 24px;   }</p> <p>```</p> <ul> <li>Properties and Values: CSS properties define the aspects of an element that you want to style, such as <code>color</code>, <code>font-size</code>, <code>margin</code>, <code>padding</code>, and many others. These properties are assigned values that specify how the element should appear. For instance:</li> </ul> <p>css</p> <ol> <li>h1 {             font-family: Arial, sans-serif;             font-size: 36px;             color: #333;         }</li> <li>Cascade and Specificity: The \"C\" in CSS stands for \"Cascading,\" which means that styles can be applied from multiple sources, including external style sheets, internal (embedded) styles, and inline styles. When conflicting styles are encountered, CSS uses rules like specificity and the order of appearance to determine which style should be applied.</li> <li>Inheritance: CSS properties can be inherited from parent elements to child elements. For example, if you set a font family on the <code>body</code> element, it will apply to all the text within that body unless overridden by more specific styles.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"WD/Unit4/#creating-a-css-style-sheet","title":"Creating a CSS Style Sheet:","text":"<p>To create a CSS style sheet, you can follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Create a New File: Start by creating a new text file with a <code>.css</code> extension.

Introduction to CSS Properties:</p> <p>CSS properties are rules or directives that define how HTML elements should be displayed on a web page. These properties control elements' styling, including their colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and more. CSS properties are essential for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites.</p> <p>2. Syntax of CSS Properties:</p> <p>A CSS property consists of two parts: a property name and a value. The property name specifies what aspect of the element you want to style, and the value determines how that property should be applied. The property and value are separated by a colon, and each rule is terminated by a semicolon. Here's an example:</p> <pre><code>`selector {\n    property: value;\n}`\n</code></pre> <p>3. Common CSS Properties:</p> <p>Let's delve into some of the most commonly used CSS properties:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Color Properties:</p> </li> <li> <p><code>color</code>: Sets the text color.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>background-color</code>: Sets the background color of an element.</p> </li> <li> <p>Typography Properties:</p> </li> <li> <p><code>font-family</code>: Defines the font used for text.</p> </li> <li><code>font-size</code>: Sets the size of the font.</li> <li><code>font-weight</code>: Specifies the thickness of the font.</li> <li><code>text-align</code>: Aligns text within an element.</li> <li> <p><code>text-decoration</code>: Adds decoration to text (e.g., underline, overline).</p> </li> <li> <p>Layout Properties:</p> </li> <li> <p><code>width</code> and <code>height</code>: Determine the dimensions of an element.</p> </li> <li><code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code>: Control spacing around an element.</li> <li><code>display</code>: Defines how an element is displayed (e.g., block, inline).</li> <li> <p><code>position</code>: Sets the positioning method for an element (e.g., relative, absolute).</p> </li> <li> <p>Border and Box Properties:</p> </li> <li> <p><code>border</code>: Specifies the border around an element.</p> </li> <li><code>border-radius</code>: Rounds the corners of an element.</li> <li> <p><code>box-shadow</code>: Adds a shadow effect to an element's box.</p> </li> <li> <p>Background Properties:</p> </li> <li> <p><code>background-image</code>: Sets an image as the background.</p> </li> <li><code>background-repeat</code>: Defines how a background image repeats.</li> <li> <p><code>background-position</code>: Specifies the position of a background image.</p> </li> <li> <p>Transform and Transition Properties:</p> </li> <li> <p><code>transform</code>: Applies 2D or 3D transformations (e.g., rotate, scale).</p> </li> <li> <p><code>transition</code>: Adds smooth transitions to element changes (e.g., hover effects).</p> </li> <li> <p>Flexbox and Grid Properties:</p> </li> <li> <p><code>display: flex</code> and related properties create flexible layouts.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>display: grid</code> and related properties create grid-based layouts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Media Query Properties:</p> </li> <li> <p><code>@media</code>: Allows for responsive design by applying styles based on screen size.</p> </li> </ul> <p>4. Inheritance and Specificity:</p> <p>CSS properties follow the rules of inheritance and specificity:</p> <ul> <li>Inheritance: Some CSS properties are inherited by child elements from their parent elements. For example, the <code>font-family</code> property is often inherited. If a parent element defines the font family, child elements will inherit it unless explicitly overridden.</li> <li>Specificity: When multiple CSS rules apply to the same element, the specificity of the selectors determines which styles are applied. Specificity is based on the type of selector (e.g., class, ID, element) and the order of declaration in the stylesheet.</li> </ul> <p>5. CSS Selectors:</p> <p>To apply CSS properties to specific HTML elements, you use selectors. Selectors target elements based on their type, attributes, classes, IDs, or other criteria. Some common selectors include:</p> <ul> <li>Element Selector: Targets all instances of a specific HTML element (e.g., <code>p</code> for paragraphs).</li> <li>Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class attribute (e.g., <code>.button</code>).</li> <li>ID Selector: Targets a unique element with a specific ID attribute (e.g., <code>#header</code>).</li> <li>Descendant Selector: Targets elements that are descendants of another element (e.g., <code>ul li</code>).</li> <li>Pseudo-class Selector: Targets elements based on their state (e.g., <code>:hover</code> for hover effects).</li> <li>Attribute Selector: Targets elements with specific attribute values (e.g., <code>[type=\"text\"]</code> for input fields).</li> </ul> <p>6. CSS Box Model:</p> <p>Understanding the CSS box model is crucial for layout and spacing. It consists of four parts:</p> <ul> <li>Content: The actual content of the element (e.g., text, images).</li> <li>Padding: The space between the content and the border.</li> <li>Border: The border surrounding the padding and content.</li> <li>Margin: The space outside the border, separating elements.</li> </ul> <p>You can control the dimensions of these components using CSS properties like <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, <code>margin</code>, <code>padding</code>, and <code>border</code>.</p> <p>7. CSS Units:</p> <p>CSS properties often use different units for measurements, such as pixels (<code>px</code>), percentages (<code>%</code>), ems (<code>em</code>), and rems (<code>rem</code>). Understanding which unit to use and when is crucial for responsive design and layout control.</p> <p>8. External CSS vs. Inline CSS vs. Internal CSS:</p> <p>CSS can be applied to HTML documents in three main ways:</p> <ul> <li>External CSS: A separate CSS file linked to the HTML document.</li> <li>Inline CSS: CSS defined directly within an HTML element's <code>style</code> attribute.</li> <li>Internal CSS: CSS defined within the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in the HTML document's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section.</li> </ul> <p>Each method has its use cases, with external CSS being the most common for maintainability and separation of concerns.</p> <p>9. CSS Frameworks:</p> <p>CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, and Bulma provide pre-designed CSS classes and components to streamline web development. They offer a consistent and responsive design system, reducing the need for custom CSS.</p> <p>10. CSS Preprocessors:</p> <p>CSS preprocessors like Sass and Less extend the capabilities of CSS by introducing variables, mixins, and functions. These preprocessors enhance code modularity and maintainability.</p>"},{"location":"WD/Unit4/#css-styling-background-text-format-controlling-fonts","title":"CSS Styling (Background, Text Format, Controlling Fonts)","text":"<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a fundamental technology in web development that allows you to control the visual presentation of HTML elements.

These elements typically start on a new line and take up the full width available within their parent container. Block elements create a distinct \"block\" or \"box\" in the web page's layout, and they are fundamental for organizing and structuring content. Block elements can contain other block elements or inline elements.</p> <p>Characteristics of Block Elements:</p> <ol> <li>Start on a New Line: Block elements are usually placed on a new line in the layout, creating a clear separation from other elements. Examples of block elements include <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>, and more.</li> <li>Full Width: By default, block elements expand to fill the entire width of their containing element (usually the parent container), unless their width is explicitly defined. This makes them suitable for creating distinct sections or containers on a web page.</li> <li>Can Contain Other Elements: Block elements can contain other block elements and inline elements. For example, a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element can hold text, images, other <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements, and more. This nesting capability allows for complex page layouts.</li> <li>Semantic Meaning: Many block elements carry semantic meaning, indicating the purpose of the content they enclose. For instance, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> elements represent headings of different levels, while <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements are used for creating lists.</li> </ol> <p>Usage of Block Elements:</p> <p>Block elements are used extensively in web development for structuring content and controlling layout. Here are some common use cases:</p> <ol> <li>Text and Paragraphs: <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements are used for defining paragraphs of text. They create clear separations between different blocks of content.</li> <li>Headings: <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> elements are used for headings with varying levels of importance. They help structure content hierarchically.</li> <li>Lists: <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements are used for creating unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items, respectively.</li> <li>Divisions: <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements are often used as generic containers for grouping and styling content. They are commonly used in CSS for layout purposes.</li> <li>Tables: The <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>, and related elements are used for creating tabular data structures. Tables can be used to present data in rows and columns.</li> <li>Forms: Form elements like <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> are block elements that facilitate user input and data submission.</li> </ol> <p>Block Elements and Layout:</p> <p>Block elements play a crucial role in controlling the layout of a web page. They enable web developers to structure content into well-defined sections, columns, and blocks. When combined with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), block elements can be styled, positioned, and manipulated to achieve various layout designs.</p> <p>For example, a common layout structure might involve using <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> elements as block-level containers to create a typical webpage layout with a header, navigation menu, main content area, sidebar, and footer.

It consists of several components: content, padding, border, and margin. Let's describe each component and how they affect the layout of an HTML element:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Content: The content area is the innermost part of the box and holds the actual content of the element, such as text, images, or other HTML elements. Its size is determined by the element's width and height properties.</p> </li> <li> <p>Padding: Padding is the space between the content and the element's border. It can be added using the padding property. Padding provides spacing within the element and affects the element's overall size.</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>.box {\n  padding: 20px; /* Adds 20px of padding on all sides of the content */\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Border: The border surrounds the padding and content area, creating a visible boundary for the element. You can set the border's width, style, and color using the border property.</p> <pre><code>.box {\n  border: 2px solid #333; /* 2px solid border with color #333 */\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Margin: Margin is the space outside the element's border, separating it from other elements. It can be added using the margin property. Margins are used to control the spacing between elements on a web page.</p> <pre><code>.box {\n  margin: 10px; /* Adds 10px of margin around the element */\n}\n</code></pre> <p>These components collectively determine the total space occupied by an HTML element. For example, if you set the width of an element to 200px, and it has 10px of padding, a 2px border, and 20px of margin, the total width of the box would be 232px (200px + 2 10px + 2 2px + 2 * 20px).</p> <p>To create responsive web designs, CSS provides advanced techniques and properties, such as media queries and flexbox. Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the screen size or device, making your website adapt to various devices and screen resolutions. Flexbox is a layout model that simplifies the creation of flexible and responsive layouts, making it easier to align and distribute elements within a container.</p> <p>Here's an example of using media queries to adjust styles based on screen size:</p> <pre><code>/* Styles for screens with a width less than 600px */\n@media (max-width: 600px) {\n  .box {\n    width: 100%; /* Make the element occupy the full width */\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, when the screen width is 600px or less, the .box element will take up the full width of its container.</p> <p>These advanced CSS techniques help you create responsive and adaptable web layouts, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.</p>"},{"location":"WD/WD-CAE-2-Question-Bank/#question-6-explain-the-concept-of-cascading-style-sheets-css-and-provide-at-least-three-css-properties-commonly-used-in-web-design-briefly-describe-how-each-property-affects-the-styling-of-a-web-page","title":"Question 6: Explain the concept of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and provide at least three CSS properties commonly used in web design.

CSS allows web designers and developers to define how web content should be displayed, including aspects like layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness. Here are three commonly used CSS properties in web design and how each property affects the styling of a web page:</p> <p>color Property:</p> <ul> <li>Description: The color property is used to define the text color of an element.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>    p {\n        color: blue;\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>Effect: This sets the text color of all <p> elements to blue. It affects the foreground color of the text content within the element.</p> <p>font-size Property:</p> <p>Description: The font-size property determines the size of the font used for text within an element. Example:</p> <pre><code>\n    h1 {\n        font-size: 24px;\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>Effect: This increases the font size of all  headings to 24 pixels, making the text larger and more prominent. <p>margin Property:</p> <p>Description: The margin property defines the space outside the element's border, creating separation between elements. Example:</p> <pre><code>\n        .container {\n            margin: 10px;\n        }\n</code></pre> <p>Effect: Adds a margin of 10 pixels around all elements with the class \"container.\" This provides spacing between adjacent elements.</p> <p>These CSS properties are just a small sample of the many properties available in CSS. They allow designers and developers to precisely control the appearance and layout of web pages, making it possible to create visually appealing and well-structured websites.</p>"},{"location":"WD/WD-CAE-2-Question-Bank/#question-7-design-implement-all-types-of-popup-boxes-using-javascript-code-for-password-validation-co4","title":"Question 7: Design &amp; implement all types of popup boxes using JavaScript code for password validation.

The type of a variable is determined based on the value it holds at runtime.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dynamic Type Changes: Variables in JavaScript can change their types during their lifetime. For example, a variable initially holding a number can later hold a string or an object.</p> </li> <li> <p>No Type Annotations: JavaScript does not require type annotations or explicit type declarations in variable declarations. You can simply assign values to variables.</p> </li> <li> <p>Type Coercion: JavaScript performs type coercion, which means it automatically converts values from one type to another when necessary. For example, concatenating a string and a number will result in a string.</p> </li> <li> <p>Flexibility and Expressiveness: Dynamic typing provides flexibility and expressiveness, allowing developers to write code more quickly and adapt to changing requirements.</p> </li> </ul> <p>While dynamic typing offers flexibility, it can also lead to runtime errors if not used carefully.

This cross-browser compatibility allows JavaScript code to run consistently across different browsers and platforms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Platform Independence: JavaScript code is executed by the web browser's JavaScript engine, making it independent of the underlying operating system (OS). This means that JavaScript functions the same way on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other operating systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Client-Side Language: JavaScript primarily runs on the client side, within the user's web browser. As a result, it does not rely on server-specific configurations or dependencies, making it platform-agnostic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Web Standards: JavaScript is based on web standards defined by organizations like the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). These standards ensure that JavaScript code is interoperable across various platforms and adheres to consistent rules.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Advantages of JavaScript in Web Development:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Interactivity: JavaScript enables the creation of dynamic and interactive web applications.

Lexical Analysis (Scanner):</p> <ul> <li>This phase breaks the source code into tokens or lexemes.</li> <li>It removes comments, whitespace, and irrelevant details from the source code.</li> <li>It identifies keywords, identifiers, constants, and operators.</li> </ul> <p>b. Syntax Analysis (Parser):</p> <ul> <li>This phase checks the syntax of the source code to ensure it adheres to the language's grammar rules.</li> <li>It builds a parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the structure of the code.</li> </ul> <p>c.

This optimization is based on the concept that if a variable's value is assigned to another variable (a copy), then the two variables are equivalent in terms of their values within a specific scope. Copy propagation reduces the number of variable accesses, leading to more efficient code.

Dead-code elimination is essential in optimizing code and reducing the program's footprint.</p> <p>(iii) Code Motion: Code motion, often referred to as loop-invariant code motion (LICM), is a compiler optimization that identifies expressions or instructions within loops that do not change their values across loop iterations.

Reduction in strength is essential for improving the efficiency of code, especially in numeric or computational applications, where performance is critical.

Brief in detail: Relational, Entity-Relationship data model","text":"<p>Relational Data Model:</p> <p>The Relational Data Model is a fundamental framework for organizing and managing data in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It was introduced by Edgar Codd in 1970 and is widely used in modern database systems. Here's a more detailed explanation:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Tables: In the Relational Data Model, data is organized into tables, which are also referred to as relations. Each table consists of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). The rows represent individual records, while the columns represent the attributes or properties of those records.</p> </li> <li> <p>Keys: Each table typically has a primary key that uniquely identifies each record within the table. Additionally, tables can have foreign keys, which establish relationships between tables by referencing the primary key of another table.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Integrity: The relational model enforces data integrity through constraints. Common constraints include primary key constraints (to ensure uniqueness), foreign key constraints (to maintain referential integrity), and various other rules for data validation.</p> </li> <li> <p>SQL (Structured Query Language): To interact with relational databases, SQL is used. SQL allows users to perform operations like inserting, updating, querying, and deleting data from tables. It also supports complex queries for retrieving and manipulating data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Normalization: The relational model promotes data normalization to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. This involves breaking down data into separate tables to eliminate data duplication and minimize update anomalies.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Entity-Relationship (ER) Data Model:</p> <p>The Entity-Relationship Data Model is a conceptual and visual representation of the data and its relationships within an organization or system. It's often used to design databases and understand the structure of data. Here's a more detailed explanation:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Entities: In the ER model, entities are real-world objects, concepts, or things that are relevant to the system being modeled. Each entity is represented as a rectangular box in the ER diagram and corresponds to a table in the relational database.</p> </li> <li> <p>Attributes: Attributes are properties or characteristics of entities. They are depicted as ovals connected to the entity boxes in the ER diagram. In a relational database, attributes correspond to columns in a table.</p> </li> <li> <p>Relationships: Relationships describe how entities are connected to each other. They are depicted as diamond shapes in the ER diagram and establish connections between entities. In a relational database, relationships are often implemented through foreign keys.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cardinality: Cardinality defines the number of instances of one entity that are related to the number of instances of another entity in a relationship. Common cardinalities include one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.</p> </li> <li> <p>ER Diagrams: ER diagrams visually represent the data model and its components. They help database designers and stakeholders understand the structure of the data and how entities relate to each other.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"dbms/DBMS-CAE-3-Question-Bank/#3-brief-in-detail-object-based-semistructured-data-model","title":"3. Brief in detail: Object-based , Semistructured data model","text":"<p>Object-Based Data Model:</p> <p>The Object-Based Data Model is a data model that represents data using the principles of object-oriented programming. It extends the relational data model to include object-oriented concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Here's a more detailed explanation:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Objects: In the Object-Based Data Model, data is organized into objects. An object is an instance of a user-defined class and combines data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit. These objects are similar to the objects in object-oriented programming languages like Java or C++.</p> </li> <li> <p>Classes: Classes define the structure and behavior of objects. They serve as blueprints for creating objects. Each class defines a set of attributes and methods that its objects will have.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inheritance: Inheritance allows for the creation of new classes by inheriting attributes and methods from existing classes. This promotes code reuse and the modeling of \"is-a\" relationships between classes. For example, you can have a base class like \"Vehicle\" and derive specific classes like \"Car\" and \"Motorcycle\" from it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Encapsulation: Encapsulation ensures that the data and behavior of an object are encapsulated within the object, and external entities can only interact with the object through its defined methods. This provides data security and abstraction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This allows for flexibility and dynamic dispatch of methods.</p> </li> <li> <p>Complex Data Structures: Object-Based Data Models are useful for representing complex data structures, including nested objects, arrays, and more, which can be challenging to represent in traditional relational databases.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Semi-Structured Data Model:</p> <p>The Semi-Structured Data Model is a flexible data model that does not impose a rigid structure like the relational model but still provides some structure and organization. It is commonly used for data that doesn't fit neatly into tables with fixed schemas, such as XML and JSON data. Here's a more detailed explanation:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Flexible Structure: Semi-structured data does not adhere to a fixed schema, meaning that different records or documents can have varying structures. Each data item can have different attributes or elements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Self-Descriptive: Semi-structured data often includes metadata or information about the data itself. This self-descriptive nature allows data to be more flexible and adaptable to changing requirements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hierarchical: Semi-structured data is often organized hierarchically, making it suitable for representing data with parent-child relationships. XML and JSON, for example, use hierarchical structures.</p> </li> <li> <p>NoSQL Databases: Many NoSQL databases, such as document databases and key-value stores, support semi-structured data. They allow you to store and query data without a predefined schema.</p> </li> <li> <p>Schema Evolution: Semi-structured data is well-suited for scenarios where the schema of the data can evolve over time without requiring a disruptive change to existing data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Query Flexibility: While querying semi-structured data can be more complex compared to relational databases, it offers greater flexibility in accommodating data that doesn't fit into a rigid, tabular structure.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"dbms/DBMS-CAE-3-Question-Bank/#4-design-an-er-diagram-of-library-management-system","title":"4.

Here, I'll describe the concept of views and then explain some common types of views in detail.</p> <p>Basic View Concepts:</p> <ul> <li>A view is defined using a SELECT statement and is stored as a virtual table in the database.</li> <li>Views are typically used to restrict access to certain columns or rows of a table, provide an abstracted layer over complex joins, or simplify querying for end-users.</li> <li>Views do not store data themselves; they are simply saved query results.</li> <li>Users can query views just like they query tables, and views can be used as data sources for other views or as part of more complex queries.</li> </ul> <p>Common Types of Views:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Simple View:</p> <ul> <li>A simple view is based on a single table or can join multiple tables but doesn't contain any aggregate functions or GROUP BY clauses.</li> <li>It is created by selecting a subset of columns or rows from one or more tables.</li> <li>Simple views are often used to hide certain columns or to provide a simplified perspective on the data.</li> </ul> <p>Example of creating a simple view:</p> <p>sql</p> </li> <li> <p><code>CREATE VIEW EmployeeView AS     SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName     FROM Employees;</code></p> <ul> <li> <p>Complex View:</p> </li> <li> <p>A complex view can contain multiple tables, joins, aggregate functions, and GROUP BY clauses.</p> </li> <li>They are used for more advanced data manipulation and often serve as a way to create a consolidated report.</li> </ul> <p>Example of creating a complex view:</p> <p>sql</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>CREATE VIEW SalesSummary AS SELECT     Product.Name,     SUM(Sale.Quantity) AS TotalSold FROM Sales JOIN Product ON Sales.ProductID = Product.ProductID GROUP BY Product.Name;</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Indexed View (Materialized View):</p> </li> <li> <p>An indexed view is a type of view that stores the result set in a materialized form, allowing for faster query performance.</p> </li> <li>The data in an indexed view is precomputed and stored, so it's especially useful for complex queries involving aggregations or joins.</li> </ul> <p>Example of creating an indexed view:</p> <p>sql</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>CREATE VIEW MaterializedSales AS SELECT     Product.Name,     SUM(Sale.Quantity) AS TotalSold FROM Sales JOIN Product ON Sales.ProductID = Product.ProductID GROUP BY Product.Name WITH SCHEMABINDING</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Partitioned View:</p> </li> <li> <p>A partitioned view is used to combine data from multiple, similar tables into a single virtual table, presenting a unified view to the users.</p> </li> <li>It can be helpful in cases where data is partitioned across multiple tables, such as for time-based data partitioning.</li> </ul> <p>Example of creating a partitioned view:</p> <p>sql</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>CREATE VIEW MonthlySales AS SELECT * FROM JanuarySales UNION ALL SELECT * FROM FebruarySales UNION ALL -- ... (continue for other months)</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Read-Only View:</p> </li> <li> <p>A read-only view is a view that's defined with the <code>WITH CHECK OPTION</code> clause, which ensures that updates, inserts, or deletes can't be performed through the view.</p> </li> <li>It is used to enforce data integrity and prevent modifications to the data via the view.</li> </ul> <p>Example of creating a read-only view:</p> <p>sql</p> </li> </ol> <p><code>CREATE VIEW ReadOnlyCustomers AS SELECT * FROM Customers WITH CHECK OPTION;</code></p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"dbms/DBMS-CAE-3-Question-Bank/#12-write-4-queries-to-use-group-by-having-order-by-functions","title":"12.

Brief in detail: NoSQL database","text":"<p>NoSQL databases (which stands for \"not only SQL\") are a family of database management systems that provide a flexible and scalable approach to data storage and retrieval. Unlike traditional relational databases, NoSQL databases do not rely on a fixed schema and are well-suited for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. They are often used in modern, distributed, and rapidly evolving applications. Here, I'll provide a detailed overview of NoSQL databases:</p> <p>Key Characteristics of NoSQL Databases:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Schema-less: NoSQL databases do not enforce a fixed schema for data. Each record or document in a NoSQL database can have its own structure, allowing for more flexible and dynamic data modeling.</p> </li> <li> <p>Non-relational: Unlike relational databases, NoSQL databases do not use the traditional tabular structure with tables, rows, and columns. They use various data models, such as key-value, document, column-family, and graph, depending on the type of NoSQL database.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, making it easier to handle large amounts of data and traffic. They are suitable for distributed and cloud-based architectures.</p> </li> <li> <p>High Performance: NoSQL databases often provide fast read and write operations, making them ideal for applications that require low-latency access to data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Distributed: Many NoSQL databases are designed for distributed data storage and retrieval, providing fault tolerance and high availability.</p> </li> <li> <p>No SQL Query Language: While traditional SQL databases use SQL for querying, NoSQL databases may use a variety of query languages, depending on the database type. Some NoSQL databases, like document stores, provide powerful query capabilities.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Types of NoSQL Databases:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Document Stores: These databases store data in semi-structured documents, such as JSON or XML. Examples include MongoDB and CouchDB.</p> </li> <li> <p>Key-Value Stores: Data is stored as key-value pairs, which is a simple and efficient way to manage data. Examples include Redis and Amazon DynamoDB.</p> </li> <li> <p>Column-family Stores: These databases organize data into column families and columns, suitable for handling large amounts of data with high write throughput. Examples include Apache Cassandra and HBase.</p> </li> <li> <p>Graph Databases: These databases are optimized for managing and querying graph-like data structures. Examples include Neo4j and Amazon Neptune.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Use Cases for NoSQL Databases:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Big Data: NoSQL databases are well-suited for handling large volumes of data generated by big data applications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Real-time Analytics: NoSQL databases can provide low-latency access to data, making them suitable for real-time analytics and reporting.</p> </li> <li> <p>Content Management Systems (CMS): NoSQL databases are used to manage and serve content for websites and digital media.</p> </li> <li> <p>IoT (Internet of Things): NoSQL databases can handle data generated by IoT devices, including sensor data and event logs.</p> </li> <li> <p>User Profile Management: NoSQL databases are used to store and manage user profiles and preferences in applications.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Example: MongoDB (Document Store)</p> <p>MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented model. It stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format, allowing for flexible data structures within each document. Here's a basic example of how data might be stored in MongoDB:</p> <p>json</p> <p><code>{   \"_id\": 1,   \"name\": \"John Doe\",   \"age\": 30,   \"email\": \"johndoe@email.com\",   \"address\": {     \"street\": \"123 Main St\",     \"city\": \"Anytown\",     \"zip\": \"12345\"   } }</code></p> <p>In this example, the data doesn't follow a rigid tabular structure, and each document can have different fields.</p>"},{"location":"dbms/DBMS-CAE-3-Question-Bank/#22-elaborate-in-detail-recent-advancements-in-database-management-system","title":"22.

SQL Commands","text":"<p>SQL Commands are instructions that are used by the user to communicate with the database, to perform specific tasks, functions and queries of data.</p> <p>Types of SQL Commands:</p> <p></p> <p>The above image broadly shows the different types of SQL commands available in SQL in the form of a chart.</p> <p>1. Data Definition Language(DDL): It changes a table\u2019s structure by adding, deleting and altering its contents. Its changes are auto-committed(all changes are automatically permanently saved in the database). Some commands that are a part of DDL are:</p> <ul> <li>CREATE: Used to create a new table in the database.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE STUDENT(Name VARCHAR2(20), Email VARCHAR2(100), DOB DATE);\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>ALTER: Used to alter contents of a table by adding some new column or attribute, or changing some existing attribute.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>ALTER TABLE STUDENT ADD(ADDRESS VARCHAR2(20));  \nALTER TABLE STUDENT MODIFY (ADDRESS VARCHAR2(20));\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>DROP: Used to delete the structure and record stored in the table.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>DROP TABLE STUDENT;\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>TRUNCATE: Used to delete all the rows from the table, and free up the space in the table.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>TRUNCATE TABLE STUDENT;\n</code></pre> <p>2. Data Manipulation Language(DML): It is used for modifying a database, and is responsible for any form of change in a database. These commands are not auto-committed, i.e all changes are not automatically saved in the database. Some commands that are a part of DML are:</p> <ul> <li>INSERT: Used to insert data in the row of a table.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>INSERT INTO STUDENT (Name, Subject) VALUES (\"Scaler\", \"DSA\");\n</code></pre> <p>In the above example, we insert the values \u201cScaler\u201d and \u201cDSA\u201d in the columns Name and Subject in the STUDENT table.</p> <ul> <li>UPDATE: Used to update value of a table\u2019s column.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>UPDATE STUDENT   \nSET User_Name = 'Interviewbit'    \nWHERE Student_Id = '2'\n</code></pre> <p>In the above example, we update the name of the student, whose Student_ID is 2, to the User_Name = \u201cInterviewbit\u201d.</p> <ul> <li>DELETE: Used to delete one or more rows in a table.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>DELETE FROM STUDENT \nWHERE Name = \"Scaler\";\n</code></pre> <p>In the above example, the query deletes the row where the Name of the student is \u201cScaler\u201d from the STUDENT table.</p> <p>3. Data Control Language(DCL): These commands are used to grant and take back access/authority (revoke) from any database user. Some commands that are a part of DCL are:</p> <ul> <li>Grant: Used to grant a user access privileges to a database.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON TABLE_1 TO USER_1, USER_2;\n</code></pre> <p>In the above example, we grant the rights to SELECT and UPDATE data from the table TABLE_1 to users - USER_1 and USER_2.</p> <ul> <li>Revoke: Used to revoke the permissions from an user.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>REVOKE SELECT, UPDATE ON TABLE_1 FROM USER_1, USER_2;\n</code></pre> <p>In the above example we revoke the rights to SELECT and UPDATE data from the table TABLE_1 from the users- USER_1 and USER_2.</p> <p>4. Transaction Control Language: These commands can be used only with DML commands in conjunction and belong to the category of auto-committed commands. Some commands that are a part of TCL are:</p> <ul> <li>COMMIT: Saves all the transactions made on a database.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>DELETE FROM STUDENTS\nWHERE AGE = 16;  \nCOMMIT;\n</code></pre> <p>In the above database, we delete the row where AGE of the students is 16, and then save this change to the database using COMMIT.</p> <ul> <li>ROLLBACK: It is used to undo transactions which are not yet been saved.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>DELETE FROM STUDENTS \nWHERE AGE = 16;  \nROLLBACK;\n</code></pre> <p>By using ROLLBACK in the above example, we can undo the deletion we performed in the previous line of code, because the changes are not committed yet.</p> <ul> <li>SAVEPOINT: Used to roll transaction back to a certain point without having to roll back the entirity of the transaction.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>SAVEPOINT SAVED;\nDELETE FROM STUDENTS \nWHERE AGE = 16;  \nROLLBACK TO SAVED;\n</code></pre> <p>In the above example, we have created a savepoint just before performing the delete operation in the table, and then we can return to that savepoint using the ROLLBACK TO command.</p> <p>5. Data Query Language: It is used to fetch some data from a database. The command belonging to this category is:</p> <ul> <li>SELECT: It is used to retrieve selected data based on some conditions which are described using the WHERE clause. It is to be noted that the WHERE clause is also optional to be used here and can be used depending on the user\u2019s needs.</li> </ul> <p>Example: With WHERE clause,</p> <pre><code>SELECT Name  \nFROM Student  \nWHERE age &gt;= 18;\n</code></pre> <p>Example: Without WHERE clause,</p> <pre><code>SELECT Name  \nFROM Student\n</code></pre> <p>In the first example, we will only select those names in the Student table, whose corresponding age is greater than 17. In the 2nd example, we will select all the names from the Student table.</p>"},{"location":"dbms/SQL-Cheat-Sheet/#5-sql-constraints","title":"5. SQL Constraints","text":"<p>Constraints are rules which are applied on a table.

UNIQUE: Specifies that this column can have only Unique values, i.e the values cannot be repeated in the column.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE Student\n(\n   ID int(8) UNIQUE,\n   NAME varchar(10) NOT NULL,\n   ADDRESS varchar(20)\n);\n</code></pre> <p>In the above example, we create a table Student and declare the ID column to be unique using the UNIQUE constraint.</p> <p>3. Primary Key: It is a field using which it is possible to uniquely identify each row in a table. We will get to know about this in detail in the upcoming section.</p> <p>4. Foreign Key: It is a field using which it is possible to uniquely identify each row in some other table. We will get to know about this in detail in the upcoming section.</p> <p>5. CHECK: It validates if all values in a column satisfy some particular condition or not.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE Student\n(\n   ID int(6) NOT NULL,\n   NAME varchar(10),\n   AGE int CHECK (AGE &lt; 20)\n);\n</code></pre> <p>Here, in the above query, we add the CHECK constraint into the table. By adding the constraint, we can only insert entries that satisfy the condition AGE &lt; 20 into the table.</p> <p>6. DEFAULT: It specifies a default value for a column when no value is specified for that field.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE Student\n(\n   ID int(8) NOT NULL,\n   NAME varchar(50) NOT NULL,\n   CLASS int DEFAULT 2\n);\n</code></pre> <p>In the above query, we set a default value of 2 for the CLASS attribute.

Purpose of Data Models:</p> <ul> <li>Data models are essential for designing and structuring databases in a way that accurately represents the data and its relationships.</li> <li>They help in creating a clear and consistent structure for data, facilitating data retrieval, modification, and analysis.</li> </ul> <p>2. Common Types of Data Models:</p> <ul> <li>Relational Data Model: The relational model represents data as tables (relations) with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). It is widely used in relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.</li> <li>Hierarchical Data Model: In this model, data is organized in a tree-like structure, with parent-child relationships. It is used in some database systems, especially in hierarchical databases.</li> <li>Network Data Model: The network model extends the hierarchical model by allowing multiple parent-child relationships. It is used in network databases.</li> <li>Object-Oriented Data Model: This model represents data as objects with attributes and methods. It is used in object-oriented databases.</li> <li>Entity-Relationship (E-R) Data Model: The E-R model represents data as entities, attributes, and relationships. It is widely used for designing relational databases.</li> </ul> <p>3. Components of Data Models:</p> <ul> <li>Entities: Entities are real-world objects, concepts, or events that are represented in the data model. For example, in a library database, books, authors, and borrowers could be entities.</li> <li>Attributes: Attributes are properties or characteristics of entities. In the library database, attributes of a book could include ISBN, title, and publication date.</li> <li>Relationships: Relationships define how entities are connected or associated with each other. In the library database, there would be relationships between books and authors, books and borrowers, etc.</li> </ul> <p>4. Diagrams and Notations:</p> <ul> <li>Data models are often represented graphically using diagrams. Common notations include entity-relationship diagrams (ERD) for the E-R model and tables with rows and columns for the relational model.</li> </ul> <p>5. Abstraction Levels:</p> <ul> <li>Data models can be categorized into different abstraction levels:</li> <li>Conceptual Data Model: This represents the high-level, abstract view of data without concern for implementation details.</li> <li>Logical Data Model: The logical model focuses on defining the structure and relationships of data, usually without considering specific database management systems.</li> <li>Physical Data Model: The physical model defines how data is actually stored in a database, including details such as data types and indexing.</li> </ul> <p>6. Data Normalization:</p> <ul> <li>Data normalization is the process of organizing data in a relational database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves breaking down data into related tables and defining relationships.</li> </ul> <p>7. Benefits of Data Models:</p> <ul> <li>Data models provide a clear and structured way to represent data, making it easier to design databases and understand data relationships.</li> <li>They facilitate communication between database designers, developers, and users.</li> <li>Data models help ensure data consistency, accuracy, and data integrity.</li> </ul> <p>8.

They are depicted as diamond shapes connecting entities.</li> <li>Relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many, indicating the cardinality of the relationship.</li> <li>For instance, in an E-R diagram for a library database, there might be a \"BORROWS\" relationship between the \"STUDENT\" entity and the \"BOOK\" entity.</li> </ul> <p>4. Cardinality and Multiplicity:</p> <ul> <li>Cardinality and multiplicity indicate the number of instances of one entity that are related to the number of instances of another entity through a relationship.</li> <li>For example, in a one-to-many relationship between \"AUTHOR\" and \"BOOK,\" an author can write many books, but each book is written by one author.</li> </ul> <p>5. Key Attributes:</p> <ul> <li>Key attributes are attributes that uniquely identify instances of an entity. In an E-R diagram, they are typically underlined.</li> <li>For example, in an \"EMPLOYEE\" entity, the \"EmployeeID\" attribute might serve as the key attribute.</li> </ul> <p>6. Weak Entities:</p> <ul> <li>Some entities, known as weak entities, do not have a unique key attribute. They rely on a related strong entity to provide their identity.</li> <li>Weak entities are typically represented with a double rectangle in an E-R diagram.</li> </ul> <p>7. Superclass and Subclass (Inheritance):</p> <ul> <li>In E-R diagrams, you can depict the concept of inheritance, where a superclass (parent entity) has subclasses (child entities) that inherit attributes and relationships from the superclass.</li> <li>For instance, a \"VEHICLE\" superclass might have subclasses \"CAR\" and \"MOTORCYCLE\" with their specific attributes.</li> </ul> <p>8. Participation Constraints:</p> <ul> <li>Participation constraints indicate whether entities are required to participate in a relationship (total participation) or if participation is optional (partial participation).</li> </ul> <p>9. Modifying Relationships:</p> <ul> <li>Relationships can be modified with labels, such as \"owns,\" \"manages,\" or \"enrolls,\" to provide additional information about the nature of the relationship.</li> </ul> <p>10. Diagram Notations:</p> <ul> <li>E-R diagrams use various notations, symbols, and lines to represent entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinality.</li> <li>Crow's Foot notation and Chen notation are two common styles of E-R diagram notation.</li> </ul> <p>11. Use Cases:</p> <ul> <li>E-R diagrams are used during the design phase of a database to illustrate the structure of the database, including tables, keys, and relationships.</li> <li>They serve as a visual aid for database designers and developers to understand and communicate the database schema.</li> </ul> <p>12. Database Implementation:</p> <ul> <li>E-R diagrams are an important step in the process of designing and implementing a database. Once the E-R diagram is created, it can be translated into a physical database schema, complete with tables, keys, and data types.</li> </ul> <p>E-R diagrams play a vital role in database design and communication between stakeholders. They help ensure that the database accurately represents the real-world entities and their relationships, leading to well-structured and efficient database systems.</p>"},{"location":"dbms/Unit1/#relational-database-design","title":"Relational Database Design","text":"<p>Relational database design is the process of structuring data in a way that ensures data integrity, accuracy, and efficiency within a relational database management system (RDBMS). It involves creating tables, defining relationships, and establishing constraints to store and retrieve data effectively. Here's a comprehensive explanation of relational database design:</p> <p>1. Understanding Data Requirements:</p> <ul> <li>The first step in relational database design is understanding the data requirements of the system or application.</li> <li>This involves identifying the entities, attributes, and relationships that need to be represented in the database.</li> </ul> <p>2. Entity-Relationship Diagram (E-R Diagram):</p> <ul> <li>A crucial step in database design is creating an Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagram to visualize the entities, attributes, and relationships.</li> <li>The E-R diagram serves as a blueprint for designing the database tables.</li> </ul> <p>3. Normalization:</p> <ul> <li>Normalization is the process of organizing data in a relational database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.</li> <li>It involves decomposing large tables into smaller ones, ensuring that each table represents a single, well-defined entity or concept.</li> </ul> <p>4. Primary Keys:</p> <ul> <li>Each table in a relational database must have a primary key. A primary key is a unique identifier for the records in the table.</li> <li>It ensures that each record in the table is distinguishable and that data integrity is maintained.</li> </ul> <p>5. Foreign Keys:</p> <ul> <li>Foreign keys are used to create relationships between tables. A foreign key in one table references the primary key in another table.</li> <li>This establishes the relationships and enforces referential integrity, ensuring that data in related tables remains consistent.</li> </ul> <p>6. Data Types and Constraints:</p> <ul> <li>For each attribute in a table, you need to specify the data type, such as text, number, date, or boolean.</li> <li>Constraints, such as unique constraints, check constraints, and default values, can be applied to ensure data accuracy and consistency.</li> </ul> <p>7. Indexing:</p> <ul> <li>Indexes are used to speed up data retrieval operations. They provide a quick way to locate records based on certain columns.</li> <li>Indexing is essential for optimizing query performance.</li> </ul> <p>8. Database Normal Forms:</p> <ul> <li>Relational databases should adhere to specific normal forms to minimize data redundancy and anomalies. Common normal forms include 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.</li> </ul> <p>9. Denormalization:</p> <ul> <li>While normalization reduces data redundancy, there are cases where denormalization is necessary for performance reasons.</li> <li>Denormalization involves introducing redundancy into the database to optimize query performance.</li> </ul> <p>10. Database Diagram:</p> <ul> <li>After defining the tables, keys, relationships, and constraints, a database diagram can be created to illustrate the complete database schema.</li> </ul> <p>11. Implementing the Database:</p> <ul> <li>Once the database design is finalized, it can be implemented in the chosen RDBMS, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.</li> <li>Tables are created, and data is inserted according to the design.</li> </ul> <p>12. Testing and Optimization:</p> <ul> <li>Database design should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it meets the data requirements and performs efficiently.</li> <li>Performance optimization, query tuning, and indexing may be necessary.</li> </ul> <p>13. Maintenance and Updates:</p> <ul> <li>Ongoing database maintenance involves tasks such as data backup, data migration, and schema updates to accommodate changing data requirements.</li> </ul> <p>14. Data Security:</p> <ul> <li>Security measures, such as user authentication, access control, and encryption, should be implemented to protect the database.</li> </ul> <p>Relational database design is a structured and iterative process that requires a deep understanding of data requirements and relationships. Well-designed databases play a critical role in the success of software applications and data-driven businesses by ensuring data accuracy, integrity, and efficient data retrieval.</p>"},{"location":"dbms/Unit1/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>https://www.javatpoint.com/dbms-architecture</li> <li>https://www.javatpoint.com/dbms-notation-of-er-diagram</li> </ul>"},{"location":"dbms/Unit2/","title":"SQL Concepts","text":"<ul> <li>SQL Concepts<ul> <li>SQL Concepts</li> <li>Basics of SQL</li> <li>DDL, DML, DCL</li> <li>Structure Creation</li> <li>Alteration</li> <li>Defining Constraints</li> <li>Functions</li> <li>Aggregate Functions</li> <li>Built-In Functions: Numeric, Date, and String Functions</li> <li>Set Operations</li> <li>Sub-queries</li> <li>Correlated Sub-queries</li> <li>Use of GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY</li> <li>Join and Its Types</li> <li>Exist, Any, All</li> <li>Views and Their Types</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"dbms/Unit2/#sql-concepts_1","title":"SQL Concepts","text":"<p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful and standardized language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It enables users to interact with databases to perform various operations, such as retrieving data, inserting records, updating information, and defining database structures. SQL concepts are fundamental to working with relational databases. Here are some key SQL concepts:</p> <p>1. Data Retrieval:</p> <ul> <li>SQL allows users to retrieve data from a database using queries. The <code>SELECT</code> statement is used for this purpose.</li> <li>Example:</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';</code></p> <p>2. Data Modification:</p> <ul> <li>SQL provides statements like <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> to add, modify, or delete data in a database.</li> <li>Example:</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>INSERT INTO products (product_name, price) VALUES ('Laptop', 1000);</code></p> <p>3. Data Definition:</p> <ul> <li>SQL supports Data Definition Language (DDL) statements like <code>CREATE</code>, <code>ALTER</code>, and <code>DROP</code> for defining and managing database structures, such as tables, indexes, and constraints.</li> <li>Example:</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>CREATE TABLE customers (     customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     first_name VARCHAR(50),     last_name VARCHAR(50),     email VARCHAR(100) );</code></p> <p>4. Transaction Control:</p> <ul> <li>SQL includes statements like <code>COMMIT</code>, <code>ROLLBACK</code>, and <code>SAVEPOINT</code> to manage transactions and ensure data consistency.</li> <li>Example:</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>BEGIN; -- Start a transaction UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 123; SAVEPOINT before_withdraw; UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 456; -- If the next statement fails, you can rollback to the \"before_withdraw\" savepoint. COMMIT; -- Commit the transaction</code></p> <p>5. Security and Access Control:</p> <ul> <li>SQL allows administrators to grant or revoke permissions for users and roles to access and manipulate data.</li> <li>Example:</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON employees TO HR_Manager;</code></p> <p>6. Functions:</p> <ul> <li>SQL provides various built-in functions for performing operations on data. This includes string functions, numeric functions, and date functions.</li> <li>Example:</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM employees;</code></p> <p>7. Aggregation:</p> <ul> <li>SQL supports aggregation functions such as <code>SUM</code>, <code>AVG</code>, <code>COUNT</code>, and <code>MAX</code> to perform calculations on groups of data.</li> <li>Example:</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department;</code></p> <p>8.

Whether you're querying a database, inserting data, or defining its structure, these basics are fundamental to working with SQL. Let's explore these basics in detail:</p> <p>1. SQL Statements:</p> <ul> <li>SQL consists of various statements, each with a specific purpose. Common statements include <code>SELECT</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, and <code>DELETE</code>.</li> </ul> <p>2. SQL Keywords:</p> <ul> <li>SQL keywords are reserved words that have specific meanings in SQL statements. Examples include <code>SELECT</code>, <code>FROM</code>, <code>WHERE</code>, and <code>JOIN</code>.</li> </ul> <p>3. SQL Syntax:</p> <ul> <li>SQL has a specific syntax that must be followed for statements to be executed correctly. For example, a basic <code>SELECT</code> statement looks like this:</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;</code></p> <p>4. Comments:</p> <ul> <li>SQL supports single-line and multi-line comments to document code and provide explanations. Single-line comments start with <code>--</code>, and multi-line comments are enclosed in <code>/* */</code>.</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>-- This is a single-line comment  /*    This is a    multi-line comment */</code></p> <p>5. Case Sensitivity:</p> <ul> <li>SQL is generally case-insensitive for keywords, but it may be case-sensitive for data. For example, \"SELECT\" and \"select\" are equivalent, but \"JohnDoe\" and \"johndoe\" are different.</li> </ul> <p>6. Data Types:</p> <ul> <li>SQL supports various data types for columns, such as <code>INT</code> for integers, <code>VARCHAR</code> for variable-length character strings, and <code>DATE</code> for dates.</li> </ul> <p>7. Wildcards:</p> <ul> <li>SQL provides wildcard characters like <code>%</code> and <code>_</code> for pattern matching in <code>WHERE</code> clauses. <code>%</code> matches any number of characters, and <code>_</code> matches a single character.</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>SELECT * FROM employees WHERE last_name LIKE 'S%';</code></p> <p>8. Functions:</p> <ul> <li>SQL includes built-in functions for data manipulation, such as <code>CONCAT()</code> for string concatenation and <code>SUM()</code> for summing values.</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM employees;</code></p> <p>9. Sorting and Ordering:</p> <ul> <li>SQL allows you to sort query results using the <code>ORDER BY</code> clause, which can arrange data in ascending (default) or descending order.</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>SELECT product_name, price FROM products ORDER BY price DESC;</code></p> <p>10. Grouping:</p> <ul> <li>The <code>GROUP BY</code> clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns. It is often used with aggregate functions.</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department;</code></p> <p>11. Aliases:</p> <ul> <li>Aliases give columns or tables temporary names. This is often used to make query results more readable or to handle self-joins.</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>SELECT employee_id AS ID, first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name FROM employees;</code></p> <p>12. NULL Values:</p> <ul> <li>SQL has special handling for NULL values, which represent missing or unknown data. You can use <code>IS NULL</code> or <code>IS NOT NULL</code> to filter data accordingly.</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>SELECT product_name FROM products WHERE supplier_id IS NULL;</code></p> <p>13. Data Modification:</p> <ul> <li>SQL supports data modification statements like <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> for adding, changing, or removing data from a database.</li> </ul> <p>14. Constraints:</p> <ul> <li>Constraints define rules for the data in a table, ensuring data integrity. Common constraints include <code>PRIMARY KEY</code>, <code>FOREIGN KEY</code>, and <code>CHECK</code>.</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>CREATE TABLE employees (     employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,     last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,     hire_date DATE CHECK (hire_date &gt;= '2000-01-01') );</code></p> <p>15. Joins:</p> <ul> <li>Joins combine data from multiple tables based on related columns. Common join types include <code>INNER JOIN</code>, <code>LEFT JOIN</code>, and <code>RIGHT JOIN</code>.</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>SELECT employees.first_name, departments.department_name FROM employees INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;</code></p> <p>16. Subqueries:</p> <ul> <li>Subqueries are nested queries within a larger query. They are used to retrieve data based on results from another query.</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>SELECT product_name FROM products WHERE product_id IN (SELECT product_id FROM order_details WHERE order_id = 123);</code></p> <p>17.

Structuring a database is a critical step in database design, as it determines how data will be organized and stored. Let's explore the key aspects of structure creation:</p> <p>1. Creating Tables:</p> <ul> <li>Tables are the primary data storage containers in a relational database. They consist of rows and columns, where each row represents a record, and each column represents a field. You create tables using the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <p>sql</p> <p><code>CREATE TABLE employees (     employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     first_name VARCHAR(50),     last_name VARCHAR(50),     hire_date DATE );</code></p> <p>In the example above, we created a table named \"employees\" with columns for employee ID, first name, last name, and hire date.</p> <p>2. Data Types:</p> <ul> <li>Each column in a table has a specified data type that defines the kind of data it can store. Common data types include <code>INT</code> for integers, <code>VARCHAR</code> for variable-length character strings, and <code>DATE</code> for date values.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <p>sql</p> <p><code>CREATE TABLE products (     product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     product_name VARCHAR(100),     price DECIMAL(10, 2),     release_date DATE );</code></p> <p>In this example, we defined the data types for the \"products\" table columns, including product ID, product name, price, and release date.</p> <p>3. Primary Keys:</p> <ul> <li>A primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It enforces data integrity and ensures that records are unique. You define a primary key using the <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> constraint.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <p>sql</p> <p><code>CREATE TABLE customers (     customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     first_name VARCHAR(50),     last_name VARCHAR(50),     email VARCHAR(100) );</code></p> <p>Here, the \"customer_id\" column is designated as the primary key for the \"customers\" table.</p> <p>4. Constraints:</p> <ul> <li>Constraints are rules applied to columns to maintain data integrity. Common constraints include <code>UNIQUE</code>, <code>NOT NULL</code>, and <code>CHECK</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <p>sql</p> <p><code>CREATE TABLE orders (     order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     order_date DATE,     customer_id INT,     total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (total_amount &gt;= 0) );</code></p> <p>In this example, we applied a <code>CHECK</code> constraint to the \"total_amount\" column to ensure that it's always non-negative.</p> <p>5. Indexes:</p> <ul> <li>Indexes are used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations, such as searching and filtering. You can create indexes on one or more columns using the <code>CREATE INDEX</code> statement.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <p>sql</p> <p><code>CREATE INDEX idx_employee_last_name ON employees(last_name);</code></p> <p>In this case, an index is created on the \"last_name\" column of the \"employees\" table to speed up searches based on last names.</p> <p>6. Foreign Keys:</p> <ul> <li>Foreign keys establish relationships between tables by linking a column in one table to the primary key column in another table. This enforces referential integrity.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <p>sql</p> <p><code>CREATE TABLE order_details (     order_detail_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     order_id INT,     product_id INT,     quantity INT,     FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id),     FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id) );</code></p> <p>In the \"order_details\" table, the \"order_id\" and \"product_id\" columns are foreign keys, referencing the primary keys in the \"orders\" and \"products\" tables.</p> <p>Creating the structure of a database is a crucial aspect of SQL, as it defines how data will be organized, stored, and related within the database.

Constraints define limits and relationships within the data, and they are used to prevent the entry of incorrect or inconsistent data. Let's explore common types of constraints and how they are defined in SQL:</p> <p>1. Primary Key Constraint:</p> <ul> <li>A Primary Key Constraint ensures that each row in a table is uniquely identifiable. It enforces the uniqueness and non-nullability of the specified column(s).</li> <li>Primary keys are used to create relationships between tables and identify records.</li> <li>Example:</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>CREATE TABLE students (     student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,     last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL );</code></p> <p>In this example, the \"student_id\" column is designated as the primary key.</p> <p>2. Unique Constraint:</p> <ul> <li>A Unique Constraint enforces the uniqueness of values in a column, but unlike the primary key, it allows null values.</li> <li>It ensures that no two rows can have the same value in the specified column(s).</li> <li>Example:</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>CREATE TABLE employees (     employee_id INT UNIQUE,     first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,     last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL );</code></p> <p>Here, the \"employee_id\" column has a unique constraint.</p> <p>3. Foreign Key Constraint:</p> <ul> <li>A Foreign Key Constraint establishes a relationship between two tables by enforcing referential integrity. It ensures that values in one table's column match the values in another table's primary key.</li> <li>Example:</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>CREATE TABLE orders (     order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     customer_id INT,     order_date DATE,     FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id) );</code></p> <p>In this case, the \"customer_id\" column in the \"orders\" table references the \"customer_id\" column in the \"customers\" table.</p> <p>4. Check Constraint:</p> <ul> <li>A Check Constraint defines conditions that values in a column must satisfy. It allows you to restrict the range of valid values.</li> <li>Example:</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>CREATE TABLE products (     product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,     price DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (price &gt; 0) );</code></p> <p>The check constraint ensures that the \"price\" column contains positive values.</p> <p>5. Not Null Constraint:</p> <ul> <li>A Not Null Constraint enforces that a column cannot contain null values. It ensures that every row must have a value in the specified column.</li> <li>Example:</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>CREATE TABLE customers (     customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,     last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL );</code></p> <p>In this example, both the \"first_name\" and \"last_name\" columns must have non-null values.</p> <p>6. Default Constraint:</p> <ul> <li>A Default Constraint provides a default value for a column if no value is specified during an insert operation.</li> <li>Example:</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>CREATE TABLE orders (     order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     order_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE );</code></p> <p>The \"order_date\" column will have the current date as its default value if not specified.</p> <p>7. Check Constraint for Date Range:</p> <ul> <li>Check constraints can also be used to ensure that date values fall within a specific range.</li> <li>Example:</li> </ul> <p>sql</p> <p><code>CREATE TABLE employees (     employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     hire_date DATE CHECK (hire_date &gt;= '2000-01-01' AND hire_date &lt;= '2023-12-31') );</code></p> <p>In this example, the check constraint ensures that the \"hire_date\" falls within the specified date range.</p> <p>Constraints are essential for maintaining data quality and consistency in a database. They help prevent errors, enforce relationships between tables, and ensure that data conforms to business rules and requirements.</p>"},{"location":"dbms/Unit2/#functions","title":"Functions","text":"<p>In SQL, functions are pre-defined operations that can be applied to data in the database. Functions allow you to perform calculations, manipulate strings, work with dates, and more. They are commonly used in SQL queries to transform and retrieve data.

User-Defined Functions (UDFs):</p> <ul> <li>Some database management systems allow you to create your own user-defined functions. UDFs are custom functions created by users to perform specific tasks that are not covered by built-in functions.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <p>sql</p> <p><code>-- Creating a simple UDF in PostgreSQL CREATE FUNCTION add_two_numbers(a INT, b INT) RETURNS INT AS $$ BEGIN   RETURN a + b; END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;  -- Using the UDF SELECT add_two_numbers(5, 3) AS result;</code></p> <p>In this example, a user-defined function <code>add_two_numbers</code> is created to add two integers.</p> <p>7. Case Expression:</p> <ul> <li>The <code>CASE</code> expression is a powerful feature that allows conditional logic within a query. It can be used to perform different actions based on specified conditions.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <p>sql</p> <p><code>SELECT   order_id,   CASE     WHEN total_amount &gt; 1000 THEN 'High Value'     WHEN total_amount &gt; 500 THEN 'Medium Value'     ELSE 'Low Value'   END AS order_category FROM orders;</code></p> <p>The <code>CASE</code> expression categorizes orders based on their total amount.</p> <p>Functions in SQL are versatile and enable you to perform various operations on data, transforming and retrieving information as needed for your specific queries and reporting requirements.

These databases offer flexible data models and are particularly suitable for applications that require scalability, high availability, and the ability to handle large volumes of data.</p> <p>One of the key characteristics of NoSQL databases is their schema flexibility. Unlike relational databases, which require a predefined schema, NoSQL databases allow you to store unstructured or semi-structured data, making them ideal for applications like content management systems, social media platforms, and real-time analytics.</p> <p>There are several types of NoSQL databases, including:</p> <p>1. Document-based Databases: These databases store data in semi-structured documents (e.g., JSON or XML) and are suitable for content management systems, blogs, and catalogs.</p> <p>Example: MongoDB</p> <p>json</p> <p><code>{   \"_id\": ObjectId(\"5fbf9d2b34479f0a77b24a0f\"),   \"title\": \"Introduction to NoSQL Databases\",   \"author\": \"John Smith\",   \"date\": ISODate(\"2023-10-01T14:30:00Z\"),   \"content\": \"NoSQL databases are designed for flexibility...\" }</code></p> <p>2. Key-Value Stores: Key-value stores associate a unique key with its corresponding value. They are efficient for caching, session management, and real-time analytics.</p> <p>Example: Redis</p> <p>python</p> <p><code>SET \"user:123\" \"John Smith\"</code></p> <p>3.

It includes the work of employees, managers, and entrepreneurs. The quantity and quality of labor play a significant role in determining a nation's economic output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Capital: Capital includes all man-made resources used in the production process. This encompasses machinery, equipment, tools, buildings, and technology. Capital helps improve the efficiency and productivity of labor, as it provides the means to produce goods and services.</p> </li> <li> <p>Entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurship represents the ability to organize the other factors of production (land, labor, and capital) to create goods and services.

When consumers and businesses increase their spending, it can drive up prices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cost-Push Inflation: This type of inflation is driven by increased production costs, such as rising wages or the cost of raw materials. These cost increases are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Built-In Inflation: Also known as wage-price inflation, it occurs when businesses raise prices to compensate for increased labor costs, and workers demand higher wages to keep up with rising prices.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Effects of Inflation:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Purchasing Power Erosion: Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money. Consumers can buy less with the same amount of currency.</p> </li> <li> <p>Uncertainty: High or unpredictable inflation rates can create economic uncertainty, making it challenging for businesses and individuals to plan for the future.</p> </li> <li> <p>Interest Rates: Central banks may raise interest rates to combat high inflation, which can impact borrowing costs and economic growth.</p> </li> <li> <p>Income Redistribution: Inflation can affect different income groups differently. Those with fixed incomes may find it harder to make ends meet.</p> </li> <li> <p>Savings and Investments: Inflation erodes the real value of savings and investments.

Other measures include the Producer Price Index (PPI), which tracks changes in wholesale prices, and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator, which measures the overall price level within an economy.</p> <p>Controlling Inflation: Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, use monetary policy tools like interest rates to control inflation. Fiscal policy, involving government spending and taxation, can also play a role in inflation control. The goal is often to maintain price stability and low, manageable inflation rates to support economic growth.</p> <p>Hyperinflation: In extreme cases, hyperinflation can occur, leading to a rapid and uncontrollable increase in prices. This can devastate an economy, causing currency devaluation and severe economic disruption.</p> <p>Inflation and Economic Growth: Moderate inflation can be a sign of a healthy economy with increasing demand.

Taxes can be categorized as either direct taxes or indirect taxes based on how they are levied and who bears the economic burden.</p> <p>Direct Taxes:</p> <ol> <li>Income Tax: This is a tax imposed on an individual's or business's income. It is calculated as a percentage of a person's earnings or a business's profits. The more one earns, the higher the income tax rate. Direct taxes are borne by the person or entity on whom they are levied. For individuals, this includes income tax, capital gains tax, and property tax. For businesses, it includes corporate income tax.</li> </ol> <p>Indirect Taxes:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Value Added Tax (VAT): VAT is a consumption tax levied on the value added at each stage of production and distribution. It is ultimately paid by the end consumer. Businesses collect VAT on their sales and remit it to the government. The consumer pays the tax when purchasing the final product.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sales Tax: Sales tax is similar to VAT but is typically levied only once at the point of retail sale. It is also ultimately paid by the end consumer when they make a purchase.</p> </li> <li> <p>Excise Tax: Excise taxes are applied to specific goods, often deemed harmful or non-essential, such as alcohol, tobacco, gasoline, and luxury items. They are typically included in the price of the product, and consumers pay them indirectly.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Progressive vs. Regressive Taxes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Progressive Taxes: These taxes take a larger percentage of income from high-income individuals than from low-income individuals. The income tax is an example of a progressive tax because higher earners are subject to higher tax rates.</p> </li> <li> <p>Regressive Taxes: These taxes take a larger percentage of income from low-income individuals than from high-income individuals. Indirect taxes, like sales tax, can be regressive because they impose the same rate on everyone, regardless of income.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Taxation Policy: Tax policy is a critical tool for governments to raise revenue and influence economic behavior. The choice of tax types and rates can impact income distribution, economic growth, and fiscal sustainability.</p> <p>Tax Evasion vs. Tax Avoidance: Tax evasion involves illegal activities to avoid paying taxes, such as underreporting income or hiding assets. Tax avoidance, on the other hand, involves using legal means to reduce tax liability, such as taking advantage of tax incentives or deductions.</p> <p>Taxation Challenges: Governments must strike a balance between generating revenue to fund public services and minimizing the economic burden on individuals and businesses. Taxation policies are continually debated and evolve to adapt to changing economic and social conditions.</p>"},{"location":"eeim/Unit2/#new-economic-policy","title":"New Economic Policy","text":"<p>The New Economic Policy (NEP) was a significant economic reform introduced in the Soviet Union by Vladimir Lenin in the early 1920s.

The NEP introduced elements of market-oriented economic reforms and private enterprise within a predominantly socialist framework.</p> <p>Key Features of the New Economic Policy:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Market Reforms: The NEP allowed for the partial reestablishment of markets. Small-scale private businesses, known as \"Nepmen,\" emerged, and agricultural producers had more control over their surplus output, which they could sell in open markets.</p> </li> <li> <p>State Ownership: While private businesses were permitted, large-scale industry and strategic sectors remained under state control. The government continued to own major industries and foreign trade.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pricing Flexibility: Prices were partially liberalized, allowing supply and demand to influence pricing. This provided incentives for production and trade.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tax Reforms: The NEP introduced a tax system that replaced the previous policy of grain requisition with a tax in kind. This system allowed peasants to pay taxes with a portion of their agricultural output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Foreign Trade: The government actively engaged in foreign trade and established trade agreements with other countries. This helped to secure essential goods and technology for the Soviet Union.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Goals and Rationale of the NEP:</p> <ul> <li>The NEP was implemented to address the economic crisis and famine that resulted from the policies of War Communism.</li> <li>It aimed to stimulate agricultural and industrial production, boost food supplies, and create a more stable economic environment.</li> <li>The NEP was seen as a temporary measure to rebuild the war-torn country while maintaining the socialist framework.</li> </ul> <p>Results and Legacy:</p> <ul> <li>The NEP led to an improvement in agricultural production and food supplies.</li> <li>It created a period of relative economic stability and allowed the Soviet economy to recover from the devastation of World War I and the Russian Civil War.</li> <li>However, the NEP also led to social inequality and the emergence of a wealthier class of Nepmen.</li> <li>The policy was met with internal opposition, including debates within the Communist Party about its compatibility with socialist principles.</li> </ul> <p>End of the NEP:</p> <ul> <li>The NEP was gradually phased out in the late 1920s and early 1930s as Joseph Stalin rose to power.</li> <li>Stalin initiated a series of economic and political changes that culminated in the launch of the first Five-Year Plan in 1928, signaling a return to more centralized economic planning and collectivization.</li> </ul> <p>The New Economic Policy was a significant chapter in the economic history of the Soviet Union.

These relationships help provide a more comprehensive understanding of how different use cases within a system or software application are related and how they collaborate.</p> <p>Let's explore some of the common types of relationships among use cases:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Association Relationship: An association relationship shows that two or more use cases are related or associated with each other in some way. It doesn't specify the direction of the interaction but indicates a general association. For example, if two use cases often occur together or share some common elements, you can represent this using an association relationship. </p> </li> <li> <p>Include Relationship: The include relationship indicates that one use case includes another use case. This means that the included use case is a part of the main use case and is essential for its execution. The inclusion relationship is often used to represent shared or reusable functionality. For instance, a \"Make Payment\" use case might include an \"Authenticate User\" use case.</p> </li> <li> <p>Extend Relationship: The extend relationship represents optional or conditional behavior that can extend the functionality of a base use case under specific conditions. It indicates that an extending use case can add extra behavior to the base use case if certain conditions are met. For example, an \"Order Processing\" use case might be extended by an \"Apply Discount\" use case if the user is eligible for a discount.</p> </li> <li> <p>Generalization Relationship: In UML, generalization represents inheritance. When one use case generalizes another, it means that the generalized use case serves as a superclass, and the generalizing use case is a subclass that inherits its behavior. This relationship is often used to show how a more specific use case inherits characteristics from a more general one. </p> </li> <li> <p>Dependency Relationship: Dependency relationships between use cases indicate that one use case relies on another, but it's not necessarily a direct association or inclusion. It signifies that a change in one use case may affect another. Dependencies can be used to represent indirect relationships and can be valuable for managing change impact.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Understanding and effectively using these relationships among use cases is crucial for modeling complex systems and applications accurately. These relationships help project teams and stakeholders visualize how different parts of the system interact, collaborate, and depend on each other, contributing to a better overall understanding of system behavior and architecture.</p> <p>Here's a summary table of the common types of relationships among use cases, including when to use them:</p> Relationship Type Description When to Use Association Indicates a general association between use cases. When two or more use cases are loosely related or associated. Include Specifies that one use case includes another. When one use case is essential for the execution of another. Extend Represents optional or conditional behavior. When a use case may extend the functionality of another. Generalization Indicates inheritance between use cases. When a specific use case inherits behavior from a general one. Dependency Shows reliance between use cases. When one use case depends on another indirectly."},{"location":"sepm/SEPM-CAE-2-Question-Bank/#9-write-short-notes-on-a-class-diagram-b-activity-diagram","title":"9. Write short notes on a.

Functional Components: FPA is based on the identification of functional components in a software application. These components are classified into five categories: 1. External Inputs (EIs): These are user inputs that add, modify, or delete data within the system. Each EI is counted based on its complexity. 2. External Outputs (EOs): These are data sent out from the system as a result of user interactions. EOs are counted based on their complexity. 3. External Inquiries (EQs): These are requests for information from the system, involving data retrieval. EQs are counted based on their complexity. 4. Internal Logical Files (ILFs): These represent data maintained by the system. ILFs are counted based on the number of data elements and their complexity. 5. External Interface Files (EIFs): These are files shared between the software system and external applications. EIFs are counted based on the number of data elements and their complexity.</p> <p>b. Complexity Weights: Each functional component is assigned a complexity weight, which indicates the complexity level of the component (e.g., simple, average, complex).

They use processes, data stores, data flows, and external entities to model the flow of information.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Dictionary: A data dictionary is a centralized repository that defines data elements, their attributes, and their relationships. It provides a common understanding of data across the project.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Petri Nets: Petri Nets are a mathematical modeling tool used for modeling concurrent and distributed systems. They are particularly valuable for modeling systems where multiple processes or activities can occur simultaneously. Petri Nets provide a visual way to represent the flow of activities and decisions within a system.</p> <p>Key Concepts in Petri Nets:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Places and Transitions: Petri Nets use places to represent states or conditions and transitions to represent events or actions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tokens: Tokens move between places and transitions, representing the progress of activities within the system.</p> </li> <li> <p>Concurrency: Petri Nets can model concurrent activities, making them suitable for systems with parallel processes.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Data Dictionary: A data dictionary is a centralized repository that defines data elements, their attributes, and their relationships.

Design modeling provides a variety of different views of the system like architecture plan for home or building. Different methods like data-driven, pattern-driven, or object-oriented methods are used for constructing the design model. All these methods use set of design principles for designing a model. Designing a model is an important phase and is a multi-process that represent the data structure, program structure, interface characteristic, and procedural details. It is mainly classified into four categories \u2013 Data design, architectural design, interface design, and component-level design.</p> <ul> <li>Data design: It represents the data objects and their interrelationship in an entity-relationship diagram. Entity-relationship consists of information required for each entity or data objects as well as it shows the relationship between these objects. It shows the structure of the data in terms of the tables. It shows three type of relationship \u2013 One to one, one to many, and many to many. In one to one relation, one entity is connected to another entity. In one many relation, one Entity is connected to more than one entity. un many to many relations one entity is connected to more than one entity as well as other entity also connected with first entity using more than one entity.</li> <li>Architectural design: It defines the relationship between major structural elements of the software. It is about decomposing the system into interacting components. It is expressed as a block diagram defining an overview of the system structure \u2013 features of the components and how these components communicate with each other to share data.

It refers to the product where user interact with controls or displays of the product. For example, Military, vehicles, aircraft, audio equipment, computer peripherals are the areas where user interface design is implemented. UI design becomes efficient only after performing usability testing. This is done to test what works and what does not work as expected. Only after making the repair, the product is said to have an optimized interface.</li> <li>Component level design: It transforms the structural elements of the software architecture into a procedural description of software components.

Bottom-Up Integration Testing \u2013 In bottom-up testing, each module at lower levels are tested with higher modules until all modules are tested. The primary purpose of this integration testing is that each subsystem tests the interfaces among various modules making up the subsystem. This integration testing uses test drivers to drive and pass appropriate data to the lower-level modules.</li> </ol> <p>Advantages:</p> <ul> <li>In bottom-up testing, no stubs are required.</li> <li>A principal advantage of this integration testing is that several disjoint subsystems can be tested simultaneously.</li> <li>It is easy to create the test conditions.</li> <li>Best for applications that uses bottom up design approach.</li> <li>It is Easy to observe the test results.</li> </ul> <p>Disadvantages:</p> <ul> <li>Driver modules must be produced.</li> <li>In this testing, the complexity that occurs when the system is made up of a large number of small subsystems.</li> <li>As Far modules have been created, there is no working model can be represented.</li> </ul> <p>3. Top-Down Integration Testing \u2013 Top-down integration testing technique is used in order to simulate the behaviour of the lower-level modules that are not yet integrated. In this integration testing, testing takes place from top to bottom. First, high-level modules are tested and then low-level modules and finally integrating the low-level modules to a high level to ensure the system is working as intended.</p> <p>Advantages:</p> <ul> <li>Separately debugged module.</li> <li>Few or no drivers needed.</li> <li>It is more stable and accurate at the aggregate level.</li> <li>Easier isolation of interface errors.</li> <li>In this, design defects can be found in the early stages.</li> </ul> <p>Disadvantages:</p> <ul> <li>Needs many Stubs.</li> <li>Modules at lower level are tested inadequately.</li> <li>It is difficult to observe the test output.</li> <li>It is difficult to stub design.</li> </ul> <p>4. Mixed Integration Testing \u2013 A mixed integration testing is also called sandwiched integration testing. A mixed integration testing follows a combination of top down and bottom-up testing approaches. In top-down approach, testing can start only after the top-level module have been coded and unit tested. In bottom-up approach, testing can start only after the bottom level modules are ready.

Structured design techniques help developers to deal with the size and complexity of programs. Analysts create instructions for the developers about how code should be written and how pieces of code should fit together to form a program.</p> <p>Software Engineering is the process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining software. The goal of software engineering is to create software that is reliable, efficient, and easy to maintain. System design is a critical component of software engineering and involves making decisions about the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a software system.</p> <p>System Design Strategy refers to the approach that is taken to design a software system. There are several strategies that can be used to design software systems, including the following:</p> <ol> <li>Top-Down Design: This strategy starts with a high-level view of the system and gradually breaks it down into smaller, more manageable components.</li> <li>Bottom-Up Design: This strategy starts with individual components and builds the system up, piece by piece.</li> <li>Iterative Design: This strategy involves designing and implementing the system in stages, with each stage building on the results of the previous stage.</li> <li>Incremental Design: This strategy involves designing and implementing a small part of the system at a time, adding more functionality with each iteration.</li> <li>Agile Design: This strategy involves a flexible, iterative approach to design, where requirements and design evolve through collaboration between self-organizing and cross-functional teams.</li> </ol> <p>The choice of system design strategy will depend on the particular requirements of the software system, the size and complexity of the system, and the development methodology being used. A well-designed system can simplify the development process, improve the quality of the software, and make the software easier to maintain.</p> <p>Importance :</p> <ol> <li>If any pre-existing code needs to be understood, organized, and pieced together.</li> <li>It is common for the project team to have to write some code and produce original programs that support the application logic of the system.</li> </ol> <p>There are many strategies or techniques for performing system design. They are:</p> <ul> <li>Bottom-up approach:   The design starts with the lowest level components and subsystems. By using these components, the next immediate higher-level components and subsystems are created or composed. The process is continued till all the components and subsystems are composed into a single component, which is considered as the complete system. The amount of abstraction grows high as the design moves to more high levels.</li> </ul> <p>By using the basic information existing system, when a new system needs to be created, the bottom-up strategy suits the purpose.</p> <p></p> <p>Advantages:</p> <ul> <li>The economics can result when general solutions can be reused.</li> <li>It can be used to hide the low-level details of implementation and be merged with the top-down technique.</li> </ul> <p>Disadvantages:</p> <ul> <li>It is not so closely related to the structure of the problem.</li> <li>High-quality bottom-up solutions are very hard to construct.</li> <li>It leads to the proliferation of \u2018potentially useful\u2019 functions rather than the most appropriate ones.</li> </ul> <p>Top-down approach: Each system is divided into several subsystems and components. Each of the subsystems is further divided into a set of subsystems and components. This process of division facilitates forming a system hierarchy structure. The complete software system is considered a single entity and in relation to the characteristics, the system is split into sub-systems and components. The same is done with each of the sub-systems.</p> <p>This process is continued until the lowest level of the system is reached. The design is started initially by defining the system as a whole and then keeps on adding definitions of the subsystems and components. When all the definitions are combined together, it turns out to be a complete system.</p> <p>For the solutions of the software that need to be developed from the ground level, a top-down design best suits the purpose.</p> <p></p> <p>Advantages:</p> <ul> <li>The main advantage of the top-down approach is that its strong focus on requirements helps to make a design responsive according to its requirements.</li> </ul> <p>Disadvantages:</p> <ul> <li>Project and system boundaries tend to be application specification-oriented. Thus it is more likely that the advantages of component reuse will be missed.</li> <li>The system is likely to miss, the benefits of a well-structured, simple architecture.</li> <li>Hybrid Design:   It is a combination of both top-down and bottom-up design strategies. In this, we can reuse the modules.</li> </ul> <p>Advantages of using a System Design Strategy:</p> <ol> <li>Improved quality: A well-designed system can improve the overall quality of the software, as it provides a clear and organized structure for the software.</li> <li>Ease of maintenance: A well-designed system can make it easier to maintain and update the software, as the design provides a clear and organized structure for the software.</li> <li>Improved efficiency: A well-designed system can make the software more efficient, as it provides a clear and organized structure for the software that reduces the complexity of the code.</li> <li>Better communication: A well-designed system can improve communication between stakeholders, as it provides a clear and organized structure for the software that makes it easier for stakeholders to understand and agree on the design of the software.</li> <li>Faster development: A well-designed system can speed up the development process, as it provides a clear and organized structure for the software that makes it easier for developers to understand the requirements and implement the software.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"sepm/Unit4/#disadvantages-of-using-a-system-design-strategy","title":"Disadvantages of using a System Design Strategy:","text":"<ol> <li>Time-consuming: Designing a system can be time-consuming, especially for large and complex systems, as it requires a significant amount of documentation and analysis.</li> <li>Inflexibility: Once a system has been designed, it can be difficult to make changes to the design, as the process is often highly structured and documentation-intensive.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"sepm/Unit4/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>https://www.javatpoint.com/white-box-testing</li> <li>https://www.javatpoint.com/black-box-testing</li> <li>https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-regression-testing/</li> <li>https://www.browserstack.com/guide/regression-testing</li> <li>https://www.javatpoint.com/unit-testing</li> <li>https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unit-testing-software-testing/</li> <li>https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-integration-testing/?ref=lbp</li> <li>https://www.guru99.com/integration-testing.html</li> <li>https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-testing/?ref=lbp</li> <li>https://www.javatpoint.com/system-testing</li> <li>https://www.javatpoint.com/verification-and-validation-testing</li> <li>https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-system-design-strategy/</li> <li>https://www.brainkart.com/article/Internal-and-external-views-of-Testing_9085/</li> <li>https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/external-vs-internal-testing-mariya-novikava</li> <li>https://www.scaler.com/topics/fundamentals-of-software-testing/</li> <li>https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing-basics/</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sepm/Unit5/","title":"Unit 5: Project Management","text":"<ul> <li>Unit 5: Project Management<ul> <li>Estimation (FP Based, LOC Based)</li> <li>Make/Buy Decision</li> <li>COCOMO II Planning</li> <li>Project Plan</li> <li>Planning Process</li> <li>RFP Risk Management (Identification, Projection, RMMM)</li> <li>Scheduling and Tracking</li> <li>Relationship between people and effort</li> <li>Task Set \\&amp; Network</li> <li>EVA Process and Project Metrics</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"sepm/Unit5/#estimation-fp-based-loc-based","title":"Estimation (FP Based, LOC Based)","text":"<p>Estimation is a critical aspect of project management in software engineering.

It measures the functionality provided by a system from a user's perspective. This method quantifies the inputs, outputs, inquiries, and interfaces that a system has. The FP count helps in determining the size and effort required for software development. The calculation of FP involves categorizing components based on complexity and adding them up to arrive at the total FP count.</p> <p>FP estimation offers several advantages. It focuses on user requirements and functionality, which makes it a valuable tool for aligning software development with user needs. It provides a standardized metric that can be used to compare and estimate projects consistently. FP-based estimation can enhance communication between stakeholders and development teams by providing a clear, functional view of the software.</p> <p>However, FP estimation can be complex and time-consuming.

EVA is particularly useful for complex projects, where tracking progress and ensuring that the project is on track are critical.</p> <p>Key Components of the EVA Process:</p> <p>The EVA process involves several key components:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Planned Value (PV): This represents the value of the work that was planned to be completed at a specific point in time according to the project schedule. PV is also known as the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS).</p> </li> <li> <p>Earned Value (EV): EV represents the value of the work that has actually been completed at a specific point in time. It is an assessment of what has been achieved in terms of budgeted work. EV is also known as the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP).</p> </li> <li> <p>Actual Cost (AC): This is the actual cost incurred to complete the work at a specific point in time. It represents the costs associated with the work performed. AC is also known as the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP).</p> </li> <li> <p>Cost Performance Index (CPI): The CPI is a measure of cost efficiency, calculated as EV divided by AC.
